Revelation

Feel the sky crack
In an even, old style
I feel now, like before
An unanswered "while"
The time stops once,
And resumes all the more
Bringing legends and fables
A bastard, and a whore
King of a story,
Written by the queen
He trods the even battleground
His braveness, lines, between 
He sleeps in a bed
Riddled with filthy lies
Of a former life and prodigy
And a love forgotten and disguised 
A little green, a little red
Some yellow and some blue
He paints a picture of lies
With words spoken true
He lies beneath a broken lamp
A light flickering blind
While waiting now, forever still
Until he falls behind
It's not a girl, nor blizzard
Nor a book, nor a train
It's the sadness blooming
While forever standing in the rain
A heart breaking slow
Friends standing by
The regal crown, however as fine
Can never, ever die
A hope and a dream
That I never seem to learn
For once I stop, and give it up
For more I  yearn
At the end of an era, I once again stand
Once again I'm blind
I must face what comes, with faith
A future, I must find


Justification 

With an odd scent in the air
I recollect this very day
I remember a certain choice
I try to get away
I concern myself with anguish
But, what is there to fear?
The truth of the matter?
A guy with purple hair
I sit here wondering
How this came to be
Not the colouring or the image
But the fact that I'm free
Freedom entails a choice
And freedom promises peace
It provides me with a sense of passion
But gives me no relief
Was I free to do what I want? 
Was I happy in my missery?
Does this freedom come with perks? 
Was I content with captivity?
I yern for more
But all I want is my past
The one thing that was forever
The one thing that didn't last
It puts me into place
I am happy this way
I just can't find peace 
Until this goes away
With a familiar light
That I recollect this day
Feel the passion for tomorrow
Slowly fade away


All alone (all alone!) 
All alone (say goodbye forever) æ
All alone (all alone) 
All alone (til we die together! 


Restoration 

Teaching and learning 
Deciding what is best for me
Traversing the land of the greater 
And the land of the free
Deciding my future 
Based on a fickle act 
Diving up all hope 
Relying on a false fact
Revisiting a pain 
Something I used to know
Learning from experiences
But deciding not to grow
Stuck in a stupid dream
A sickness without medication 
Falling down from a blow 
But relying on a restoration 
A growing pain 
A lonelyness without a scale 
My life grows week 
And my skin grows pale 
I need this purification 
My thoughts and my actions alone 
I need to feel safe again 
Trapped, without a home 


Sensation 

Something weird and honest
Akin to something new
A though of something different
And that different was you
Married to a single time 
Unable to see ahead
A thought that hits right at home 
Waking up, or going to bed 
A toxic feeling passion
A tunnel vissioned dream 
Going up against the current
But falling down the stream
An uninterested world 
An unaverted gaze
Unable to move forward 
In this love inspired maze
I cling to this feeling 
Of a solitude that true
A thought of something honest 
And at the end there's you 



Jeg brenner mine følelser 
På en hver ting jeg tar 
Jeg lever i skyggen 
Av personen jeg en gang var
