    \part*{Introduction}
        Symmetry can often be confused with beauty. Of course, symmetry is an important part of this, but it is never the sole reasoning. Beauty is within the eye of
        the beholder. Words are subjective, opinions are a way of expressing emotion,
        and through emotion, words. Words drive literature, poetry and, in tandem
        with it, love.
        
        Through my ”discovery” intensive youth, I have lived through many situations, relationships, and friendships. Through all of these encounters, I have
        written. Since I was old enough to feel physically attracted I have written.
        Although, starting young, I never accounted for the fact that I would like to
        continue writing poems, and for a long time at it. After a while, I decided I
        wanted to write towards something that would drive a story or an underlying
        theme. This ended up as The Testament. A testament of my love towards those
        around me, and my loss and hurt within love. The Testament is the story of
        how a lost boy found himself in his life.
        
        I always knew The Testament would end at poem number one hundred, but
        I had never planned ahead. There ended up being a couple of poems in between
        books, that act as a shift in tone between The Testament and The X. The new
        book was to be more serious and focused more on the surreal and impactful of
        ones past. How hard it can be to forget people and events. The ’X’ is a symbol.
        It represents a positive future, a fulfilling present, and a forgetful past.
        Within these words and poems are real emotions, real people and most of
        all, the real me. It wasn’t written for me though. Not at all. It was written
        to remind a future iteration of me, as well as you, of who we used to be. Our
        phases in life. Our youth. Through a testament to a relationship, a calendar to
        remind one of going forward, to a story of a young man who lost his son. These
        are the real stories of boys, girls, and my nom de plume, Stitch. \\

        \poemtitle{The Flower of Life - I}
        \begin{verse}
        Some flowers are small \\
        Some bloom more \\
        When I look up to the sky \\
        I can see the stars sore \\
        When the flowers make love float in the air \\
        That's when, there is nothing to fear \\
        When the lightning cracks and heaven opens it's door \\
        That's when I relized \\
        Love is something more \\
        \end{verse}

            I know the time has come \\
            For you there might be many \\
            But for us there are just some \\
            So don't tell me \\
            What I can't or can \\

            Just take a moment, relax and swell \\
            Please! For all sakes, do tell! \\

        \poemtitle{Follow - III}
            \begin{verse}
            If you follow the beat \\
            you might get your way \\
            If you follow your instincts \\
            you might fly away \\
            If you follow love \\
            the best things will come true \\
            If you follow the stream \\
            You might find something new \\
            But if you follow yourself \\
            You can't go wrong \\
            'cause if you forfill your dream \\
            Love is always strong \\

        \poemtitle{Far Away - IV}
            \begin{verse}
                Once apon a time, there was a man who was confused \\
                He tried to impress a lady  \\
                She was not amused \\
                The poor man was in distress \\
                The poor man loved the mistress \\
                So one day, he searched for assistance \\
                He met a women of the resistance \\
                She knew how to please a lady \\
                The plan was weird \\
                And the plan was shady \\
                He knew now what he had to do \\
                So he reached the castle \\
                And he made it true \\
                He walked up to the girl \\
                He had remembered all the tips \\
                And from that moment \\
                He kissed her lips \\

        \poemtitle{Hero - V}
            \begin{verse}
                The times you wish you were the hero \\
                The times you wish you were the star \\
                The times you tried to do things right \\
                But never got any far \\
                Don't we all wish for a better future \\
                Don't we all erease the past \\
                The things that are done \\
                Are the things though of last \\
                I want to be the hero \\
                To be the one who can change \\
                To be the one with power \\
                To do the rearrange \\
                But end up being the villain \\
                For all the crimes I do \\
                I am left alone \\
                But she is too \\
                My fair maiden \\
                The one far away \\
                The one I want back \\
                The one I wan't to stay \\
                No, we cant all be the heroes \\
                Some of us must fall \\
                The greater they are \\
                The greater the call \\

                It would be nice with a hint or two \\
                If that's what I get \\
                Then thats what il do \\
                It seems like everybody has seen the light \\

        \poemtitle{Loved Ones - VII}
        \begin{verse}
            The people I loved are here today \\
            Never for me \\
            They would never stay \\
            The people I loved \\
            Never loved me back \\
            I didn't deserve it \\
            Cause of my lack \\
            For understanding their way \\
            For the things I did \\
            For future day \\
            The only person I can say ever loved me back \\
            Has a boy friend, not to ever have me \\
            Thats why i can say \\
            It could never be \\
            I have only been rejected \\
            It's really sad because \\
            I never reflected \\
            Upon the things that was important \\
            Upon the things that were true \\
            I'd never lie \\
            I adore you \\
            You know who I'm talking about \\
            The one and only one that's to shout \\
            She has a boyfriend too \\
            Not to shabby \\
            I think he'll do \\
            But then again \\
            Who am I to charge? \\
            I can't even get a girlfriend \\
            How's that for large? \\
            I wish some day  \\
            I'll find the one \\
            To hold my son \\
            The one she \\
            That's perfect for me \\

    \poemtitle{I'm Sorry. - VIII}
        \begin{verse}
            I'm sorry \\
            But i have to go \\
            I'm sorry for the things i did \\
            I'm sorry for the things that show \\
            I have to carry my own way \\
            You would make it worse if I'd stay \\
            So please, please leave me alone \\
            You brought me pain \\
            Of all the things you've done \\
            You've left me in vain \\
            I thought it would be just fine \\
            I thought I would survive \\
            I thought that you were mine \\
            But that thought left long ago \\
            Along with the believes \\
            For things that were so \\
            The things that were so good \\
            You gave me up \\
            Like you never should! \\
            Never trust me \\
            Never again \\
            Cause I'm sick of you trying to be my friend \\
            When all you do is take me down \\
            And when I fall I always drown \\
            But you have been there in between \\
            The times I didn't make it for the scene \\
            I'm sorry if you get offended \\
            But that's pretty much how this ended \\
            Listen, yes we can be friends \\
            But I can't control my self anymore \\
            So please leave me alone \\
            I't only makes me sore \\
            My love for you has always been the same \\
            But some how and some where \\
            This turned into a game \\
            But I don't want to play \\
            I don't even want to stay \\
            Please forgive me for the damage I've done \\
            I hope you have forgot me by the rise of the sun \\

    \poemtitle{Why so awkward? - X}
        \begin{verse}
            As i sit here wondering what I did \\
            The things I said \\
            The things I hid \\
            Some times I become weird \\
            I get awkward and stupid \\
            I get strange with those who cared \\
            But there is no shame \\
            Everybody can be here \\
            To blame \\
            And see that nervous is what it was \\
            And I hope you see why and because \\
            An easy explanation really \\
            Quite short quite freely \\
            It is because of love \\
            The thing that makes the birds fly above \\
            And on top of that \\
            It's normal \\
            It's good and nice \\
            It's formal \\
            Don't believe me? \\
            Look back \\
            See the time go into attack \\
            Yes there you see \\
            It's nothing to fear \\
            Nothing to be afraid of \\
            No need to stare \\

    \poemtitle{The Truth - XI}
        \begin{verse}
            For all I know the truths betrayed \\
            For all I said \\
            Has now been laid \\
            To rest somewhere \\
            Lost in time \\
            Lost is space \\
            But makes us rime \\
            And trust in the things we think are true \\
            And to fall down on what that pull us through \\
            But the truth is a happy thing \\
            For that it makes us joy and sing \\
            For all happiness for all of us \\
            And there you have it \\
            The truth is a plus \\

    \poemtitle{Hopes - XII}
        \begin{verse}
            As times change \\
            We look at the past \\
            Look at the things that didn't last \\
            Some didn't get the time to start \\
            Others made it far \\
            And wished upon a star \\
            But I, \\
            I stayed the same \\
            I didn't change \\
            Not Even for fame \\
            So now, I am as strong as ever \\
            Like Justin Bieber \\
            Never say never \\
            So do what I say \\
            And never give up your dreams \\
            That way you can invent schemes \\
            The schemes of today and tomorrow \\
            The ones that future people may borrow \\
            So use you brain and practise hard \\
            That way we can all share the shard \\

            It's really like i'm going to attack \\
            Someone for something they did \\
            Now open the jar \\
            And lift the lid \\
            I don't know what to say \\
            I don't know what to do \\
            Please help me decide \\

            I want to know! \\
            I want the truth \\
            But I guess I will never find a booth \\
            A booth that could spawn my past \\
            And tell me \\
            Did it ever last? \\

            As the time has passed \\
            The dawn breaks \\
            A new day \\
            A new way \\
            A way to start over what has been \\
            A time for all that ended \\
            To have a time to begin \\
            A way to restart \\
            A time to do what is wanted \\
            A time to do our part \\
            As time restarts \\
            The things are the same \\
            It will be like this \\
            Every day \\
            Over and over again \\

            Lurking from behind my back \\
            Trying to go for attack \\
            But you have somebody by your side \\
            And I don't know where to hide \\
            My feelings are just so blind \\
            I don't even know who to find \\
            I just know my luck has changed \\
            And all that was, is rearranged \\
            Don't think that i am the same \\
            Cause then you only have yourself to blame \\
            I've changed allot through this time \\
            I can't even follow the chime \\
            But I guess my life is better like this \\
            But maybe that is what i'l miss \\
            I hope you can accept the fate \\
            Backing out is way to late \\

            Belive my story \\
            I know i'm right \\
            I know i lie \\
            But lets not fight! \\
            But if disbelief is what covers my story \\
            Don't listen \\
            I won't worry \\
            Cause if you are correct \\
            I don't care \\
            I know i'm not perfect \\
            And if i don't share \\
            I won't stare \\

        \begin{verse}
            The number of time \\
            My own number alone \\
            The number of prophecy \\
            The number of throne \\
            It is foretold that this is the one \\
            This is what is true \\
            It cannot be undone \\
            It tells me who I am \\
            Without it, I am just a scam \\
            I will follow the path it makes \\
            So that I can use all that it takes \\
            To build it up \\
            Piece by piece \\
            Make it come true \\
            And then release \\
            Release the true power of my 21 \\
            More power than The sun \\

        \begin{verse}
            We did not have to meet \\
            For I knew what would be \\
            A sign from above \\
            And I could see \\
            I could see our friendship grow \\
            Because none of us were afraid to show \\
            Show our true selves to each other \\
            I couldn't even see if I were your brother \\
            But a thing came in the way \\
            I thought it would be fine \\
            You had a boyfriend \\
            You needed your time to shine \\
            But I slowly fell for you \\
            It was something I didn't want \\
            I swore not too \\
            But you are just so unique \\
            In a wonderful way \\
            Like the times I'm tired to go \\
            And you want me to stay \\
            The things you tell me \\
            I have never heard before \\
            But I know you are true \\
            And that makes me sure \\
            That I have fallen for you \\
            It I hope that you see \\
            That I wish that right now \\
            That it could be you and me \\

            I hope I have nothing to fear \\
            As a poem this is the worst \\

            And end up \\
            Like it never should \\
            Like it always was wrong \\
            Like it was never right \\
            Like the past is grey
            And future bright \\
            But listen to my words \\
            As I tell the tale \\
            As I make my way \\
            As I sett my sail \\
            I'm ready for more \\
            I'm ready to go \\
            I'm ready to soar \\
            I can be the hero \\
            I can take resistance \\
            I can bloom the flower \\
            I can walk the distance \\
            You can't follow the beat \\
            You can't get your way \\
            For what ever you do \\
            You cannot stay \\
            Earth, water, fire or flame \\
            What ever you do \\
            You live in shame \\
            But I move on \\
            I become new \\

            I am... \\
            I am all of me \\

            With pants of red \\
            And top of white \\
            When I see your smile \\
            My day is bright \\
            With hat of green \\
            And hair of black \\
            Ever since we met \\
            I don't need to look back \\
            With lips bright pink \\
            And eyes shining brown \\
            When I see your face \\
            I can never frown \\
            You are a friend I value best \\
            You taught me most \\
            More than the rest \\
            Without you i would not have understood \\
            And things would have been \\
            Like it never should \\
            Thank you for the things you've done \\
            And thank you for the friends we've become \\

            Right intro your eyes \\

            Oh that moment \\
            So tender and sweet \\
            But now you've left \\
            My heart confused \\
            Did you say yes \\
            Or were you re-fused? \\
            I know how people \\
            Can make one mad \\
            But even just you say it \\
            It makes me sad \\
            But I know \\
            That I'm one of the few \\
            That is strong enough to say \\
            I love you \\
            And if that is not good enough \\
            I guess I have to grow up \\
            I have to be tough \\
            But please \\
            I hope you see \\
            That I will love you forever \\

            I don't know if I'm right \\
            I don't know if I'm wrong \\
            I don't know how you feel \\
            Only that my love is strong \\
            I know I'll hesitate \\
            I can't tell you now \\
            I would tell you later \\
            I just don't know how \\
            But one day \\
            The choice will be made \\
            The one will be written \\
            And the plan will be laid \\
            So I will go now \\
            Once an forever more \\
            Past the forest \\
            And upon the open land \\
            But i will be back \\
            In one day or another \\
            If not for you \\
            For a lover \\

    \poemtitle{The Fear - XLIX}
        \begin{verse}
            I conquered the fear \\
            Of being rejected \\
            I conquered the fear \\
            Better than expected \\
            Why was I afraid? \\
            It went so well \\
            Why was I afraid? \\
            I knew I could tell! \\
            It went so well \\
            It went so fine \\
            By the shining in her eyes \\
            By the shining of mine \\
            But I guess \\
            I have learned for now \\
            I guess I finally \\
            Know how \\
            So I will go \\
            She makes me fly \\
            But I hope so dearly \\
            For never a goodbye. \\

    \poemtitle{Heroic - L}
        \begin{verse}
            The times you wish you were the hero \\
            The times you wish you were the star \\
            The times you don't longer need to follow \\
            But become who you are \\
            But listen to my words \\
            As I tell the tale \\
            As I make my way \\
            As I sett my sail \\
            Some love is meant to die \\
            Some love is meant to become \\
            But my love is meant to be given \\
            And this love is meant to be done \\
            But bloom my heart \\
            As it would never stay \\
            Just bloom my heart \\
            Like I never was away \\
            Now make me right \\
            Or make me wrong \\
            It's your choice \\
            No mater weak or strong \\
            Just remember \\
            You can be the villain \\
            For all the crimes you do \\
            So sett it free \\
            Into the blue \\
            I don't need time \\
            I don't need day \\
            For all I use \\
            Is time to pray \\
            Pray that all \\
            Will be ok \\
            Pray that you \\
            Will always stay \\
            But even though am left alone \\
            And even though I'm sorry \\
            Whatever you say \\
            It's always the same story \\
            Just remember \\
            That what ever you say \\
            Or what ever you do \\
            I will be there \\
            Like your tattoo \\
            No, we can't all be heroes \\
            Some of us must fall \\
            But we will come back stronger \\
            As heroes us all \\

        \begin{verse}
            Roses are red \\
            Violets are blue \\
            I've written a poem \\
            I've written it for you \\
            It's not about \\
            All the things you get \\
            And it's not about \\
            All the goals you set
            It's about love \\
            And sharing the joy \\
            Sharing the love \\
            Either girl or boy \\
            The question is not \\
            What is yours to get \\
            And the question is not \\
            If it will be regret \\
            It's about valentine \\
            The years true love \\
            The one days power \\
            To stare the stars above \\
            No need for gifts \\
            No need to stress \\
            No need to hurry \\
            Only you can impress \\
            But it's a flower for me \\
            Or a poem for you \\
            Cause roses are red \\
            And violets blue \\
            No need to wonder \\
            No need to be mine \\
            Just a simple question \\
            Will you be my valentine? \\

        \begin{verse}
            You might think I'm weird \\
            You might think I'm strange \\
            But what ever you say \\
            I will never change \\
            I will walk my way \\
            I will stay the same \\
            Will be my self \\
            For glory or shame \\
            You can't form me \\
            I'm not clay \\
            I will not be as you \\
            I will just walk away \\
            Cause I know who I am \\
            I know what to do \\
            I know what to say \\
            To Get though \\
            Don't need time \\
            Don't need space \\
            It's not a challenge \\
            It's not a race \\
            You have all the time \\
            To make it good \\
            But make sure \\
            It's the way it should \\

        \begin{verse}
            I lost track \\
            Where did you go? \\
            I lost my senses \\
            You didn't know \\
            I miss you \\
            But you don't see \\
            That you \\
            Were all of me \\
            Part of the life I lost \\
            Part of my past \\
            Part of the cost \\
            The cost my sanity \\
            The one that I grew \\
            You are one of many \\
            But for me \\
            One of the few \\
            I don't know what \\
            I don't know how \\
            But there is something I must do \\
            To make you bow \\
            Because you are gone \\
            And must live \\
            With the though of you \\
            And that I must give \\
            I must give up \\
            There is nothing to do \\
            Nothing for me \\
            To ever get over you \\

    \poemtitle{Monkey Kiss - LIV}
        \begin{verse}
            You made me laugh \\
            When I made the choice \\
            To get on closer \\
            To stop your voice \\
            When we first kissed \\
            It was like I fell \\
            But you picked up \\
            So I could not tell \\
            If you liked it or not \\
            So I said: " what the hell!" \\
            We'll give it another shot \\
            So I kissed you again \\
            And it lasted eternal \\
            It made my brain rumble \\
            And my heart infernal \\
            You made it easy \\
            You made it good \\
            You made me believe \\
            That it was something I should \\
            So I did it \\
            I did it with pride \\
            And now my feelings \\
            Have no need to hide \\
            So maybe \\
            It was to funky \\
            But if it was \\
            We'll blame it on monkey \\

            I've found yours \\
            But you won't find mine \\
            So you will die easily \\
            But I will be fine \\
            Oh, the damage you've done \\

            And do what you do best \\
            Being the worst \\
            And being the pest \\
            But I can see \\
            What is wrong and right \\
            And for love \\
            I attack with all might \\
            But you just go on \\
            Like what you do is nice \\
            When you really have the heart \\
            Of rock solid ice  \\

            I don't miss you \\
            I cannot lie \\
            But at least i have a reason \\
            And at least tell why \\
            You treated me \\
            Like you didn't care \\
            You make all the people \\
            Full of fear \\

            But when you're near \\
            You make me feel like home \\
            And when it all is lost \\
            And there is no going back \\
            You must understand \\
            That I will attack \\
            There is no stopping it \\
            There is no end \\
            I just want to see you \\
            But no longer as friend \\
            We are so close \\
            At least we were \\

            But I have survived \\

            It's all so sick \\
            I can't bear the thought \\
            Of what I took \\
            And of what I brought \\
            But I guess it was all away \\
            I guess I was meant to be downed \\
            But what ever you said \\
            You could not be found \\
            Doesn't matter \\
            How much you say \\

            What ever is ok \\
            Where ever you stay \\
            Cause the saliva is making me \\
            Go to where I have never been \\
            To places I can't find \\
            To places one of a kind \\
            But never take me back \\
            So I get sick \\
            Like my soul is killed \\
            Like it's all a magic trick \\
            Now I cannot stay \\
            I must go \\
            Far away \\
            But what ever \\
            I come to be \\
            The saliva is controlling me \\

            Until you've seen what can be \\
            Oh, but you will find it \\
            Just you wait and see \\
            And the damned will rise \\
            Believe my soul \\
            But to defeat them all \\
            That is our goal \\
            Infinite will come \\
            As you damned the dead \\
            So take care of your soul \\
            As it gently is shred \\
            So be prepared \\
            I'm telling you all \\
            Be afraid \\
            Cause the world will fall \\

            Give what is brought \\
            It's all a cycle \\
            A circle of living \\
            A circle of life \\
            The circle of giving \\

            Some are good \\
            Some are bad \\
            But for all the times that were good \\
            They can't relate to the sad \\
            I live so happily \\

        \begin{verse}
            An ice castle rises \\
            The snow will fall \\
            A new dream sets \\
            Controlling it all \\
            What is so wrong? \\
            It all seems so real \\
            Even though the ground might be red \\
            And the sky teal \\
            I did survive \\
            I made the dream cheat \\
            Although it only brought me \\
            Closer to my feet \\
            I all seemed so real \\
            But it was all fake \\
            Because I did fall down \\
            But I didn't break \\

            You though it would be fine \\
            And go by your plan \\
            But it drastically failed \\
            You ended up wrong \\
            What you thought was weak \\
            Stood up to be strong \\
            The man doesn't listen \\
            The man doesn't care \\
            You fought so little \\
            When you had it all to fear \\
            And now you want to go back \\
            But there is no back \\
            You have to let go \\
            You have to close down \\
            You have to go slow \\
            You don't have a choice \\
            You have to listen \\
            Listen to the mans voice \\
            There is no end \\
            For the pain you will get \\
            If you think otherwise \\
            You will regret \\
            So go away \\
            And never turn back \\
            To where ever you go \\
            I want you to stay \\
            The man said it \\
            The man made it \\
            You can't say other \\
            You can't stay other \\
            You won't be a sister \\
            You won't be a brother \\

        \begin{verse}
            This part is new \\
            It has changed a soul \\
            More powerful by thought \\
            Than to be seen as coal \\
            It is not bleak \\
            It's as light as the sky \\
            But before it became \\
            It was all a dark lie \\
            It was only encouraged \\
            By all the falls \\
            It was never broken down \\
            By gentle calls \\
            It grew more \\
            Every day \\
            You could try to kill it \\
            But it would still stay \\
            But itself got hold \\
            It figured what It had done \\
            What he had changed \\
            What he had become \\
            He changed once more \\
            Back to the light \\
            Finally it shined \\
            And it did shine bright \\
            It was finally nice \\
            It was finally free \\
            That shadow \\
            Turned out to be me \\

            I Cannot move \\
            I Cannot stay \\
            I Want to be here \\
            But want to go away \\
            When it's all so easy \\
            It is all so hard \\
            When lightning strikes \\
            You'll get hit by a shard \\
            The damage is short \\
            But the pain is forever \\
            It feels like it's here \\
            Not hit me, never \\
            When all is wrong \\
            When the moon is high \\
            You cannot go back \\

            This is my future! \\
            I can change it all \\
            I can start over \\
            Forget my fall \\
            I can now be the hero \\
            I can be all of me \\
            Why was I so dumb \\
            That I did not see \\
            That the only thing that was stopping \\
            Was me \\
            But all is gone \\
            The game has begun \\
            Time to go away \\
            Back to the sun \\
            The future that was told \\
            The past that was blue \\
            The ignorance of a human \\
            That would destroy his few \\
            The one that he cared for \\
            The ones that made him glad \\
            He turned on them \\
            He turned bad \\
            But I am done \\
            I have grown so strong \\
            I now know that they were right \\
            About me being wrong \\
            Now I will walk \\
            Like it was all a glitch \\
            I will walk, \\
            For I am Stitch \\

            While the grass grows green \\
            And the leaves bloom too \\
            Because what he as dreamt \\
            Has now become true \\
            But he wish it was gone \\
            He wish it was fake \\
            He did not know the cost \\

            Pay the price \\
            For all the mad \\
            For what is good \\

            He was a longing guy \\
            The story of them both \\
            Made me wonder why \\
            Why would a poor guy like him \\
            Ever fall for someone \\
            Whom he doesn't understand \\
            Ever from the start \\
            When she first touched his hand \\
            What would become \\
            None did know \\
            But it has to be special \\
            When you make someone go \\
            It was such a sight \\
            For what ever she said \\
            He would fight \\
            But she never saw him \\
            She just left \\
            He could just admit her \\
            Charge her for theft \\
            Because she made him believe \\
            She made it all start \\
            But from that moment \\
            She stole his heart \\

            Just be ready when all is fallen \\

            Like a deep blue ocean \\
            Like a swim in the sea \\
            It's like the moon is new \\
            When you look at me \\
            Your eyes, \\
            They hypnotise mine \\
            When you look me in the eyes \\
            I must draw the line \\
            It's unbelievable \\
            It's like a swim in the sea \\
            Looking at you \\
            Looking at me \\

    \poemtitle{One Word - LXXX}
        \begin{verse}
            That one Word \\
            Sentence of the time \\
            That one word \\
            To set a rhyme \\
            That one kiss \\
            To make all the thrill \\
            That one kiss \\
            With the fair of will \\
            That one time \\
            When all went good \\
            That one time \\
            Where it went like it should \\
            But why wait? \\
            For the time to come \\
            When the fairest of heart \\
            Is believed by some \\
            And why not hear \\
            When the stars shine bright \\
            When the moon is high \\
            Just for us tonight \\
            And for that time \\
            To finally break \\
            Do what is told \\
            To what ever you'll make \\
            Now for tonight \\
            The shine of all \\
            Just for tonight \\
            The rise of the fall \\
            But not to worry \\
            Don't come undone \\
            Do not fear \\
            Or even run \\
            It will be over \\
            I trust my word \\
            Don't trust anyone \\
            For anything you've heard \\
            The time of bad \\
            The time of good \\
            Now, it all ends \\
            The only it could \\

        \begin{verse}
            Shadows everywhere \\
            The darkness is all around \\
            It's covering my senses \\
            I can't hear a sound \\
            But I don't want to hear \\
            I cover up more \\
            I guess you have to act now \\
            Don't wait before \\
            But the shadows cover my soul \\
            The darkness fils my heart \\
            There is no end \\
            To this start \\
            The only end is the impossible \\
            You wouldn't care a bit \\
            You wouldn't care to mend \\
            You would only hit \\
            Because that's how \\
            Darkness works \\
            You should know that \\
            One person of all \\
            But I guess the caring \\

            To stop the go \\
            Now has time \\
            To start the show \\

            I've spoken the language \\
            I have sett the one lore \\

    \poemtitle{Amaranth; Forever - LXXXVI}
        \begin{verse}
            The truth is so hidden \\
            The truth is so bold \\
            But that is why i look back \\
            To the memories we hold \\
            The moon is still there \\
            The love never disappeared \\
            When it all ended \\
            It was with what I feared \\
            You told me otherwise! \\
            You told me a lie \\
            But I guess you were afraid \\
            To say goodbye \\
            But so was I \\
            But it was for the best \\
            I hope I didn't got lost \\
            Like all the rest \\
            But I had to do it \\
            To take a stand \\
            Cherish the one \\
            That hides Amaranth in a land \\
            So far away \\
            I was all of me \\
            But it was your heart \\
            That could not see \\
            I was the hero \\
            You were the one \\
            But now I'm the villain \\
            And we are done \\
            The flower bloomed \\
            The stitches been laid \\
            While you were happy \\
            I was afraid \\
            My valentine \\
            My sweet monkey kiss \\
            How could you betray me? \\
            Treat me like this? \\
            How is it that the pain is forever \\
            But action is now? \\
            For I will always know why \\
            But wonder how \\
            But that is how I chose to live \\
            You chose it too \\
            But I no longer live \\
            Because I lost you \\
            The love that you lost \\
            Is far worse \\
            Than what I lost \\
            And what you set on curse \\
            A short start \\
            An everlasting end \\
            The love of first sight \\
            Fading to a friend \\
            But that friend \\
            I don't want to be \\
            I want to forget \\
            I want you to see \\
            That what you meant to me \\
            Is not to be thrown around \\
            Because every time I smiled \\
            You threw me to the ground \\
            But it is over now \\
            No final kiss \\
            The tears will go down \\
            All because of this \\

        \poemtitle{Light of Blue - LXXXVII}
        \begin{verse}
            It is time \\
            I am done \\
            My era is over \\
            My plan has began \\
            You believe \\
            Of what you see \\
            I believe \\
            What is all of me \\
            A new time \\
            A never fading rain \\
            The sun is hidd \\
            Behind all the pain \\
            But I have rissen \\
            I have come back \\
            Not for you \\
            Never for that \\
            I am done with you \\
            I am done with all \\
            But the used ones \\
            They bring light \\
            They give the motivation \\
            For one to fight \\
            But as I am forced to move \\
            As I walk into my past \\
            Never turn back \\
            Did never last \\
            Because Turing back \\
            For me, is the only way \\
            Because I oversaw \\
            That they where the ones to stay \\
            But cherish the one \\
            The one that you oversaw \\
            Because you will be shocked \\
            You will have awe \\
            So can you see all of me? \\
            Walk right into \\
            My mystery \\
            Step inside and pray for light \\
            Pray right now \\
            Pray for it is right \\
            Because the light of blue \\
            Can only be seen by few \\

            That we all need each other \\

            For now is the time \\
            To look for where to land \\
            Hidden in the forest \\
            Lost in waters sea \\
            Forgotten in time \\
            Found and finally free \\
            The jewel of life \\
            The the master emerald bound \\
            All these mighty treasures \\
            Just waiting to be found \\

            Look back time \\
            One year has passed \\
            But the though about it \\
            Will always last \\
            You started it all \\
            You make me cry \\
            You made me fall \\
            But in the end \\
            You are the hero! \\
            You are the star! \\
            You made me start \\
            And made me go far \\
            I have you to thank \\
            My dear friend \\
            For without you \\
            It would have had to end \\
            For without you \\
            It would not have begun \\
            For without you \\
            I would never have done \\
            All the things I've done \\
            Now I thank you \\
            I thank you so much \\
            For making it true \\

            As the trees grow \\
            As the time sets in \\
            As the bottle drops down \\
            The perfect bottle gin \\
            You cannot stop \\
            Your hands shaking bright \\
            What you know is wrong \\
            Is still what feels right \\
            The smoke of cigarets \\
            The fire of ones house \\
            The drinking of whiskey \\
            Undressing of a blouse \\
            You know its wrong \\
            But where to go? \\
            When without it \\
            Your life feels slow \\
            You know what is wrong \\
            Life has the perfect prediction \\
            The final thought \\
            For your everlasting addiction \\

            A fallen angel \\
            A far awau land \\
            Taking the step \\
            To go closer to her hand \\
            Sitting still \\
            For a response \\
            When you wanted gold \\
            But all ended was bronze \\
            The fallen angel \\
            Revived by man \\
            Taken from heaven \\
            And done what can \\
            To get back to her land \\
            The land of the sky \\
            One's change like this \\
            One can't go by \\
            But to save an amaranth \\
            One needs strength \\
            Because one love \\
            Does not hold for the length \\
            One needs passion \\
            To hold the sacred one \\
            For what time you have been given \\
            Has almost just begun \\
            You must bless it \\
            Bless it with all heart \\
            Not after the end \\
            But from the start \\
            Never stop \\
            Not even for glory \\
            Not ever \\
            To end this story \\

            The one book \\

            The road of fire \\
            The one book \\
            That I thinks would take me higher \\
            But it stayed alone \\
            It never got any way \\
            The death note took over \\
            It lost it's hope to stay \\

            Never to be forgotten \\
            Never to be lost \\
            But sadly it will rotten \\
            Because this is how it works \\

            And the other made doom \\
            Only four \\

            Don't try to stitch the lies \\

            There is only one voice \\
            We cannot all learn \\
            Not from what others see \\
            For those are the things \\
            That a few can only be \\
            But now I say \\
            That power can be found \\
            For our existence is free \\
            But only for the unbound  \\
            So over the hills \\
            And far away \\
            That is the place \\
            That we all want to stay  \\

        \begin{verse}
            The clouds were forming in \\
            One December day \\
            When all was nice \\
            When the bad was away \\
            We talked that day \\
            Just like any other \\
            But that day I realised \\
            We needed each other! \\
            But that's just a memory \\
            That was our past \\
            And in the future \\
            It went up in a blast \\
            But when my honey lost momentum \\
            And the bills were piling high \\
            That's when the light had finally faded \\
            From the apple of her eye \\
            That is how it is \\
            That is how it was \\
            Memoria, \\
            I'm here because \\
            Of what you made \\
            That one December day \\
            What you said \\
            To make me stay \\
            Make my feelings for you \\
            Never go away \\
            I called it love \\
            You called it foreplay \\
            The joke is not funny \\
            The joke is on me \\
            For I am the one \\
            That did not see \\
            That Memoria \\
            The 3rd one of the four \\
            Was the one \\
            That I would beg for more \\

    \poemtitle{Second - CXI}
        \begin{verse}
            When poems first started \\
            When romance first begun \\
            That was when I was the moon \\
            And you were the sun \\
            We were so different \\
            But yet so alike \\
            For that late night \\
            I hit my strike \\
            Your love turned to hate \\
            And my love turned sad \\
            When I cried my eyes to tears \\
            While you still were mad \\
            I said I was sorry \\
            Yet the mistake was yours \\
            Because you were to jealous \\
            To finish your chores! \\
            You did not inspect  \\
            You simply said I lied \\
             But still I was the one that was evil \\
            But yet the one that cried \\
            And still you are in my heart \\
            You are still one of the four \\
            Because of what we finished \\
            I wanted more \\
            Because you simply gave up \\
            I continue to look \\
            But forever the time went \\
            And forever it all took \\
            My sweet fair maiden \\
            You are still there \\
            But upon you I laid \\
            My promise to swear \\

        \begin{verse}
            I said my sorrows \\
            I said my pain \\
            I built it up \\
            And grew my grain \\
            Like corn on a field \\
            And like the wind in the sky \\
            The sun bright shining \\
            And the clouds floating by \\
            For the years good harvest \\
            Rain clouds are a great need \\
            For it is what will make \\
            The food that will feed \\
            Now it is ready \\
            Now in the harvest's eye \\
            For now the wind is now blowing \\
            And the clouds floating by \\

        \begin{verse}
            Wild men chopping \\
            Down on all the free \\
            Chopping down memories \\
            Like it was all a tree \\
            Where all once stood \\
            There is nothing but dust \\
            For what was important \\
            Was destroyed by lust \\
            By somebody's ego \\
            By somebody's own gain \\
            For what the cutting brough \\
            Was nothing but intolerable pain \\
            Where memories once lied \\
            Now is in ruins and ash \\
            For where the love was gained \\
            Is now turned into scrap and trash \\
            Where he first touched her lips \\
            Where they both remember back \\
            Where they both lied down \\
            Where their past will always track \\
            Is now a place they despite \\
            Where they cry in pain \\
            Where it shined in the sun \\
            But now it shutters in rain \\

            Living in the palace \\
            Where it is all in place \\
            Living in the rain \\
            Living in grace \\
            Where all is fine \\
            Where we wait \\
            For the time \\
            To come back \\
            To the reality \\
            That we once shared \\
            Back to the past \\
            And back to what we fared \\
            The rain \\
            Pouring down \\
            It's where you left it \\
            Left your crown \\
            You went away \\
            Away to the place \\
            Of the places I could not stay \\
            So I stayed here \\
            I stayed in the rain \\
            In shame and grace \\
            In tears and pain \\
            But that is what I wanted \\
            Wanted all along \\
            Going back to the sun \\
            And staying strong \\
            But I knew in my heart \\
            That it would not last \\
            For an evicton of future \\
            Cannot resolve the past \\
            For as I was ignoring the future \\
            As I was ignoring the rain \\
            I was ignoring the flashbacks \\
            And i was ignoring the pain \\

        \begin{verse}
            Random people \\
            New worlds to explore \\
            Because what was expected \\
            Was needed for more \\
            But the unexplored \\
            Is as deadly as the thought \\
            Because what a challenge \\
            That timed what you caught \\
            As you even walk forward
            As your thoughts never turn \\
            As you recover from your bruises \\
            As you make the world burn \\
            For what you desire \\
            For what you once need \\
            Is what the nuzlocke wants \\
            And what the inspiration feeds \\
            For random as it may be \\
            For tasks of higher rate \\
            The nuzlocke chooses desire \\
            The nuzlocke chooses fate \\

            As the past follows in \\
            As the dark flows back \\
            As the screams go wider \\
            As the darkness attacks \\
            Amnesia razing  bleak \\
            A knife cutting through \\
            As the blood goes to the floor \\
            He goes looking for you! \\
            For as long as I don't remember \\
            I can't live like that \\
            I have to move forward \\
            And never turn back! \\
            For when in  the dark \\
            When it's all around \\
            The amnesia is heard \\
            But still without a sound \\
            A man in black \\
            A doctor in white \\
            An actor with  beauty  \\
            And a future so bright \\
            But the  doctor was evicted \\
            And the director was cut \\
            For as soon as it was done \\
            His world was shut \\
            Once again amnesia \\
            Once again my friend \\
            For the next time \\
            I will descend! \\

    \poemtitle{The Librarian Secret - VI}
        \begin{verse}
            A true past \\
            An adventure once ended \\
            One that was retrieved \\
            The one that was befriended \\
            For as long as the past goes \\
            Back to before the book \\
            Back when times were simple \\
            Where it was what it took \\
            And love, was as true as first sight \\
            Where love was as floating \\
            As a shining stars light \\
            That is where it was begun \\
            The past that's future is now \\
            This is where it got \\
            Through all the what and how \\
            The secret \\
            Of The Librarian Bird \\
            The secrets so hidden \\
            It can no longer be heard \\
            But two still remember \\
            For the force will bring them back \\
            For what he once desired \\
            Was what she once would lack \\
            The one first night \\
            Where the broadcast went viral \\
            Where they first intertwined \\
            And their love learned the spiral \\
            The second day met again \\
            Where their paths was crossed once more \\
            Where the spark was ignited \\
            And the sadness was poor \\
            But the days were dark \\
            And the time went blue \\
            For he thought they would never \\
            Ever make it through \\
            Through the spirals end \\
            Where he could get desire most \\
            For the Bird was his maiden \\
            And the past was his host \\
            They traveled far and wide \\
            Cried sorrow like a newborn \\
            But the night is always darkest \\
            Just before the dawn \\
            And the night was dark \\
            And they met once more \\
            This time the love \\
            Was no longer sore \\
            The love they shared \\
            Come together at last \\
            For that one final night \\
            To end their past \\
            Sleep once again \\
            God of things above \\
            For the time has come \\
            For the joy to all love \\
            The past now future \\
            The past of the bird \\
            The  true adventure ended \\
            The spirit now is heard \\

            Running at speeds \\
            Unknown to mankind \\
            Searching the mountains \\
            For what one cannot find \\
            A wide quest \\
            A fearsome beast \\
            Untamable creature \\
            Dangerous at least \\
            Running for your life \\
            Jumping across the land \\
            Turning  water into steam \\
            And  rocks into sand \\
            A fire in a flask \\
            The only thing that's warm \\
            The only thing to make you survive \\
            The endless shipwreck storm \\
            Endless suffering \\
            But a bright shining light \\
            One firefly put to rest \\
            And one to join the fight \\

            The fire in the flask \\
            Is all the heat \\
            But don't cry \\
            For it will all go by plan \\
            For any girl in the way \\
            I will be your man \\
            No matter what \\
            The X will lead through \\
            It will bring you me \\
            And bring me you \\

    \poemtitle{Paths - IX}
        \begin{verse}
            It is in all we see \\
            It is in all we know \\
            But we can't all decide \\
            What is the right path to go \\
            Some may offer \\
            The life of the gray \\
            Some may differ  \\
            And lie to stay away \\
            But when two paths collide \\
            In the moonlight and snow \\
            What paths to chaos \\
            And what paths to flow? \\
            And what if a robin \\
            Mysteriously flys by \\
            Would it be a hello \\
            Or would it be goodbye? \\
            If so much pain \\
            Would lead to this \\
            Then the answer to the question \\
            Is no simple kiss \\
            For a kiss is a path \\
            In which a lover must stand \\
            But the fighter doesn't have to \\
            He can take her hand \\
            And they can live in peace \\
            And they can live in grace \\
            But is that really where \\
            The soldier can take place? \\
            What ever the answer is \\
            It will not be liked or famed \\
            What ever the answer is \\
            It will be locked and framed \\
            For a despicable answer \\
            And a terrible fate \\
            What paths to sadness \\
            And what paths to hate? \\

            As I set foot into where I was \\
            As I set foot into my past \\
            As I break the barrier \\
            And walk out of the cast \\
            As time sets it's remark \\
            And brings back the street \\
            As the history change \\
            And sets you back on your feet \\
            Back to the day thought was right \\
            The day made of freedom \\
            Where you were born to fight \\
            But now I'm back to the night \\
            Back to where I started to stay \\
            But my past was distant \\
            And made me walk away! \\
            I pushed on \\
            Minding what I want \\
            But a dent in the book \\
            Simply changes the front \\
            For the very page of existence \\
            Can never disappear \\
            It can bring back memories \\
            And turn them into fear \\
            I hope they understood \\
            Why I chose who was right \\
            But that choice was wrong \\
            And I couldn't stand the sight \\
            Of my Memoria \\
            Being let loose \\
            For the broken \\
            Is the one I would choose \\
            But how can one \\
            Be so wrong \\
            After all this time \\
            Of staying strong? \\
            The hero doesn't know \\
            Neither the knight \\
            For none of them knew \\
            Who was the right \\
            For he was blinded by fear \\
            And struck to the ground \\
            For he could not see \\
            For the love he had found \\
            This one day \\
            My mistakes got made \\
            For these are the mistakes \\
            That would later have to be payed \\
            Followed by a ship \\
            Sailing into peace \\
            He saw a new sail \\
            And he sailed with ease \\
            But the wrong direction \\
            Can lead to the one who tend \\
            Should have known right from the start \\
            You can't predict the end \\

            If love can say yes \\
            If I can say no \\
            If the sun can shine bright \\
            And weather make it snow \\
            Can I do the marker's work? \\
            Can I finish a crime? \\
            Can I deal with the four, \\
            When ever it is time? \\
            Questions of fate \\
            Never changes for good \\
            Maybe it's bad \\
            Or maybe it should? \\
            If a lion should meet \\
            With a tigers eye \\
            And they both get along \\
            Who of them would die? \\
            And when, how and where? \\
            Do I ask the formidable guy \\
            For I can't get the answers \\
            From someone so shy \\
            That the answers \\
            Cannot be solved \\
            For that is what it said \\
            And what we were told \\
            Like the fish in the sea \\
            And a prawn diving the deep \\
            The answers are simple \\
            But the mountain is steep \\

    \poemtitle{Destination - XIII}
        \begin{verse}
            Back to the road \\
            Where we used to talk \\
            Back to the snow \\
            Where we used to walk \\
            And back to the place \\
            Where life used to live \\
            Back to the place \\
            Where we all used to give \\
            Now there is no place left \\
            The benchmarks are lost \\
            The shop of hope moved \\
            And the price of whatever cost \\
            Like a train moving forward \\
            To a station without talk \\
            Where the snow gently falls \\
            And where all the memories walk \\
            Where I once stood \\
            Waiting for you \\
            And when the train moved forward \\
            Your love did too \\
            For when we reached our destination \\
            When I reached into your heart \\
            When the light switched off \\
            And when our paths grew apart \\
            Where our lives entangled \\
            For the very first time \\
            And where you paid the price \\
            For every single rhyme \\
            And as I tripped back home \\
            After the love of a memory \\
            That is when I noticed \\
            You were my number three \\
            And when I stepped on the train \\
            Moving to my station \\
            That is when I discovered \\
            You were my destination \\

            Riding in the night \\
            New places, new days \\
            The feeling to feeling home \\
            Is the only thing that stays \\
            And the other \\
            Floats along \\
            Like a day bright sunshine \\
            Shining so strong \\
            But in the dark shadows \\
            And deep ice snow \\
            There is one place hidden \\
            Where no one can go \\
            So secret \\
            That only two men have ventured there \\
            For in the bright night \\
            It's presence is all but clear \\
            One can only go \\
            With the purest of heart \\
            And one will venture back \\
            Pure from the start \\

        \begin{verse}
            What keeps us warm \\
            And what keeps us aside \\
            What brings us down \\
            And what controls the tide \\
            It's all a simple question \\
            One simple solution \\
            Not rich or poor \\
            Nor death or pollution \\
            But there is one thing \\
            That makes us all mingle \\
            It's this lonely feeling \\
            And butterfly tingle \\
            The way of communication \\
            And the way of chemistry \\
            How can one be so lonely \\
            But yet so free? \\
            It's just like a quest \\
            Riding with your lord \\
            Watching his every move \\
            And every lunge of his sword \\
            Watching and learning \\
            Learning to learn \\
            Watching his move \\
            Every road, every turn \\
            But a drop o blood \\
            Or a lock of hair \\
            Choosing one like this \\
            Would it all be fair? \\
            Green or brown \\
            Blue or blond \\
            What ever one can say \\
            One can always grow fond \\
            Of things that might sound strange \\
            And things that  might look pale \\
            For what ever colour reason \\
            I will set my boat to sail \\
            Oh the past memory \\
            And the present hurricane \\
            One came to the heart \\
            But the other, deadly pain \\

            Tie My heart \\
            And pull the strings \\
            For loss it gives \\
            But pain it brings \\
            What will I be \\
            Once now the end is soon \\
            For I can look up \\
            And see the moon \\
            One star \\
            Maybe here and there \\
            But the place will remain \\
            Where I once shed my tear \\
            Where we once stood \\
            And now cannot care \\
            The place written down \\
            3 letters it is long \\
            Moving to a loss \\
            Only proves I'm wrong \\
            The wait is over \\
            The end is near \\
            For a whole world stunned \\
            A whole world full of fear \\

            Vision about travel \\
            Vision about the sky \\
            A vision that will take me away \\
            But a vision to make me cry \\
            For this vision \\
            Is only a dream \\
            It is like an artificial cake \\
            Covered in cream \\
            For it does not exist \\
            Struck down by fate \\
            Waiting down low \\

            For my future, \\
            Past and present \\
            Ends when the moon \\

            Travel along \\
            Throughout the void \\
            Through the time and space \\
            A dream that can never avoid \\
            Where Limits and rules \\
            Do not exist \\
            Where the reign of the future \\
            Is controlled by an iron fist \\
            Where my dreams lie \\
            Where my future is hold \\
            Where my past is present \\
            And where my present is gold \\
            Where my future \\
            Has merely begun \\
            Hi, I'm The Doctor! \\

            And when my time calls \\
            Lonely little life \\
            Lonely little fate \\
            Come back to me \\
            Please be my bait \\
            I am the light \\
            At the end of you \\
            I am the light \\
            Tunnelling through \\
            I am the light blinking \\
            At the end of the road \\
            Backing up my life \\
            And lifting of a load \\
            You were always the one \\
            To be followed my a crow \\
            And I would be the one \\
            Catching you as you go \\
            For I have always \\
            Stayed in your reach \\
            But that was not enough \\
            For you to start preach \\
            I would catch you \\
            You would let me stay \\
            But I would be inpatient \\
            And I would walk away \\
            You would be running downhill \\
            And I would be far away \\
            I would try to come closer \\
            But my body would be like clay \\
            Standing stiff \\
            And frozen still \\
            Climbing the ladder of life \\
            Going for the kill \\
            But I used all my time \\
            On preparing \\
            And using all my time \\
            On looking and staring \\
            When what I should have done \\
            Is jumping to the act \\
            Not denying time \\
            And ordering my fact \\
            But it will always \\
            Stay the same \\
            But I have none other \\
            But myself to blame \\
            I'm the light blinking \\
            At the end of the maze \\
            I am the light, the poet \\
            Forever and Always... \\

            I'm not here \\
            It's just a thought \\
            One can call it a dream \\
            Kind of something caught \\
            Out of the oblivion \\
            And of nothing \\
            All though it might be hard \\
            And sometimes might sting \\
            But I'm not here \\
            I still live in the rain \\
            I live in all disaster \\
            Living with regain \\
            I can't come forward \\
            And I can't go back \\
            For the only thing stoping \\
            Is the floor crack \\
            The future of today \\
            Is my past and The Note \\
            The way to return \\
            Is through what I wrote \\
            They said if you don't let them out \\
            You're gonna let them eat you away \\
            I'd rather be what they said \\
            Than be the one walking away \\
            I end at the start \\
            And everything begins once more \\
            Through the regain \\
            And through the core \\

            Bring me a animal \\
            And bring me it's horn \\
            You without heart \\
            You without mind \\
            Who can never feel compassion \\
            And can never be kind \\
            If one believes \\
            And does not doubt \\
            Can make fruit appear \\
            And throw  it all out \\
            And if he can do anything \\
            If he would be wise \\
            Why would he be so dark \\
            And make you all despise \\
            He can become a nightmare \\
            He can lift a mountain high \\
            He can bring me the welcome \\
            And he can tell me goodbye \\

            I once asked a boy \\
            Why he was so sad \\
            He told me \\
            His mother had gone mad \\
            I asked him nice \\
            And asked why he was grim \\
            His mother had been drinking \\
            And her hand,  hitting him \\
            Shocked, baffled \\
            And struck by fear \\
            I asked the little boy \\
            Why on earth was he here? \\
            A slight voice came out \\
            A little grin flew across \\
            He told me about a flower \\
            And bout his loss \\
            The flower \\
            Shining bright blue \\
            Came from his pocket \\
            And his tears came through \\
            He told me his father \\
            Had been buried \\
            Deep at sea \\
            His mother had been drinking \\
            And her problems came to be \\
            I thought bad for this boy \\
            This boy with the flower, blue \\
            His poor life depressions \\
            And all he had was through \\
            He had nothing to spare \\
            He had eyes like clean soap \\
            I asked this little innocent boy \\
            Where was all his hope? \\
            He looked up at me \\
            He laughed and smiled bright \\
            "Flowers and hope, sir \\
            How do you sleep at night?" \\
            "Sleep? I sleep well!" \\
            The boy laughed and stood tall \\
            "You think to good of yourself \\
            When all you ever do is fall \\
            What is life, \\
            Other than a goodbye?" \\
            "Life?" \\
            "It's nothing but a black lie!" \\
            A boy this age \\
            How could he know? \\
            It was like his parents were turned \\
            Into dust or snow \\
            "I cannot help you!" \\
            "Nobody can, \\
            They try their best \\
            But leave with their plan \\
            You are all the same \\
            Black suit and tie \\
            But what are you really \\
            At the apple of your eye?" \\
            Nothing but a brick, \\
            An X or a mark \\
            You are all like a dog! \\
            Bark bark bark!" \\
            This little boy \\
            Filled my soul with fear \\
            How could he be like this? \\
            What was he doing here? \\
            I was simply assigned to feed \\
            Not to investigate \\
            How could I be this cruel?  \\
            Brutality filled with hate \\
            I wanted to help him \\
            I wanted to stay! \\
            But he kept pushing \\
            And turning away \\
            Nobody helped the poor boy \\
            He passed with the years \\
            But his flower lives in us \\
            And in all our tears \\

            Never believe in power \\
            To fall for the sett \\
            It can't be this simple \\
            Something is wrong \\
            And when something loses \\
            It's power grows strong \\
            And so a fierce night starts \\
            And dream is just a glance \\
            For maybe I'm dreaming \\
            Or do I have a chance? \\
            For after a dream \\
            You wake up in paradise \\
            But something is wrong \\
            For I have not payed my price \\
            Maybe regret \\
            Or even solitude \\
            I may ask later \\
            But it's not meant to be rude \\
            Once again i'm sitting here \\
            Once again free \\
            Once again my pride \\
            Has taken over me \\
            I need to change \\
            And I need to think \\
            For my life may be over \\
            I'm my eye's next blink \\

        \poemtitle{Suffering - XXV}
        \begin{verse}
            One person stands there \\
            One person above all \\
            The One boy who fought, \\
            Tiredly, stands there tall \\
            He wouldn't back down \\
            When the night brought it's time \\
            When times were tough \\
            And as sour as a fresh lime \\
            For this one boy \\
            With nothing, but a guitar to strum \\
            Walks the razors edge \\
            Waiting for the end to come \\
            Barely able to walk \\
            Energy fading away \\
            Why must he suffer \\
            From the desire to stay? \\
            We will never know \\
            For one day will come \\
            When all is lost \\
            And a new time begun \\
            So far away \\
            We wait for the day \\
            A lifetime will be gone \\
            And we will all have to pay \\
            Not only for this boy \\
            But for the one inside of all \\
            The one that takes the suffering \\
            Without taking the fall \\
            Our sweet, sweet  hearts \\
            Aching with pain \\
            Why do we torture our feelings? \\
            And how are we sane?! \\
            When all we go through is suffering \\
            And the paths we take are false \\
            The boy can barely breathe! \\
            And his heart is losing pulse \\
            Why don't we care? \\
            Why don't we act? \\
            Why does it always end in pain \\
            When we all know the fact! \\
            The fact that we all go dark \\
            The fact that we are near death \\
            Better buckle up now \\
            He just took his last breath \\

        \poemtitle{Lemonade - XXVI}
        \begin{verse}
            When life gives you lemons \\
            You make lemonade \\
            But if life gives you complications \\
            You would wish you could trade \\
            For life doesn't give you \\
            Life will simply take \\
            For when you defeat the problem \\
            You leave everything at stake \\
            Your compassion, your joy \\
            Your love, your light \\
            For when you lose your gambling \\
            You also lose your fight \\
            Compassion, becomes hate \\
            And joy becomes a lie \\
            For that's the life you'll live \\
            If you simply stand by \\
            Change is vital, \\
            And courage is all \\
            A simple broken leg \\
            Will only break your fall \\
            When you reach the end \\
            And all that is left is pain \\
            Make sure your heart follows \\
            And make sure you stay sane \\
            For pain is temporary \\
            Pride is forever \\
            Remember that stupidity \\
            Is not a way of being clever \\
            Lose all your pride \\
            What do you have left to claim? \\
            For when you lose all motivation \\
            Everything is the same \\
            No way to live \\
            No challenge, No gain \\
            Nothing would change \\
            Nothing, but pain \\
            An everlasting sorrow \\
            Something missing, something lost \\
            A hole in you heart \\
            Covered in snow and frost \\
            You can't fill it \\
            You can't even try \\
            You have to live with your sorrow \\
            Until if the day you die \\
            So never gamble your life \\
            Never gamble your pride \\
            For what other can one need \\
            But an opportunity to hide? \\

        \poemtitle{The Violinist - XXVII}
        \begin{verse}
            A tone coming through \\
            A vibrant ringing sound \\
            After all this looking \\
            I've finally hit ground \\
            A broken rule \\
            The book's new laws \\
            This one true song \\
            Makes up for my flaws \\
            As I'm running out of time \\
            Or at least that's how I feel \\
            This one true feeling \\
            And everything's appeal! \\
            Finally stranded still \\
            On an island without hope \\
            For before this happened \\
            I would not know how to cope \\
            This is now my new home \\
            I am not stranded anymore \\
            For this is something different \\
            Different from before \\
            For now I hear the music \\
            Now I feel the light \\
            My terrible luck \\
            Is blinded by delight \\
            The violin keeps playing \\
            Throughout bumps and flail \\
            For this light will stand \\
            Others will not prevail! \\
            A musician, a genius \\
            The one and only \\
            This one I am certain \\
            Will not end lonely \\
            For it is not a "new one" \\
            But simply the first \\
            To touch the poet's heart \\
            And almost make it burst \\
            A Violinist of stars \\
            A flame burning worm \\
            For this fire in a flask \\
            Will save me from the storm \\

        \poemtitle{Her - XXVIII}
        \begin{verse}
            Every time one blinks \\
            And every breath one takes \\
            Every time one turns \\
            And every move one makes \\
            For every muscle moved \\
            And for every single heart beat \\
            Every time one crosses his fingers \\
            Or even move his feet \\
            His thoughts strive to her \\
            And all what brings too \\
            Her smile when she's blushing \\
            And when her eyes look at you \\
            You can't help but fall out \\
            And think ever so long \\
            For one to be able to break it \\
            One must have faith, be strong \\
            For she is so mesmerising, \\
            That one cannot go without \\
            Thinking about her ways \\
            And feel their heart shout \\
            She is purely fantastic \\
            She is purely one of a kind \\
            IT would be hard to discover \\
            And impossible to find \\
            Cliché, crescendo, \\
            One far, and one free \\
            She came unnoticed \\
            But, she came for me \\
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{Freedom of Zero - XXIX}
        \begin{verse}
            Beautiful creatures \\
            And beautiful paths \\
            Time's wonderful turnings \\
            And our precious laughs \\
            The way we chose to live \\
            And the fate that come to be \\
            May not be the fact \\
            Or the only thing to see \\
            We are our own paths \\
            And our own mind \\
            We choose the way to go \\
            And what we want to find \\
            May it be true love \\
            Loneliness, money or greed \\
            What ever you hunger \\
            And what you choose to feed \\
            It's all up to you \\
            At least that's what's reality \\
            But how can we know \\
            For sure that we are free? \\
            What if our minds, \\
            And our free will is bound? \\
            And what we call "fate" \\
            Has it's way of not being found \\
            What if we live \\
            In the world we love most \\
            And what if that world \\
            Is nothing but our host? \\
            We do what me must \\
            But can we ever choose? \\
            Do we really have anything to say \\
            And everything to lose? \\
            Nothing will tell \\
            And nothing ever will \\
            We will all live in envy \\
            Of what we cannot thrill \\
            But we never choose \\
            We never break the mold \\
            We do what me must \\
            And we do as we're told \\
            A wise man once said \\
            That there was a reason for all \\
            But maybe it's time to change \\
            And time to stand tall? \\
            Maybe we can \\
            Maybe it is time \\
            Maybe destiny and fate \\
            Is the poet's final rhyme? \\

        \poemtitle{Limit - XXX}
        \begin{verse}
            My life goals \\
            My life alone \\
            Amounts to nothing \\
            But a small pebble of a stone \\
            And a stone to a mountain \\
            Or a drop to the sea \\
            But yet these limits \\
            Never proves all of me \\
            For what is an ocean \\
            But a multitude of drops? \\
            But i wonder where it limits \\
            And where it stops \\
            For how much poison does it take \\
            To bring down two dears? \\
            And how much poison \\
            To poison one of his tears? \\
            One cannot limit by measures \\
            And one must not limit our soul \\
            For what is a limit \\
            But an unachieved goal? \\

        \poemtitle{Purification - XXXI}
        \begin{verse}
            Cleansing, purification \\
            A clean soul, a clean will \\
            Going from warm darkness \\
            Into the winter chill \\
            Forward and back \\
            Removal, reverse \\
            One may think it's bound \\
            Mad everlasting curse \\
            But it is as simple as one \\
            One step and one choice \\
            Close down your ears \\
            And listen to your voice \\
            What do you hear? \\
            From the deepest of your heart \\
            Cleanse your emoticons \\
            And from that is where you start \\
            From darkness to light \\
            And from sorrow to smile \\
            One will to change \\
            One will, for a while \\
            The silent demand \\
            The catharsis of soul \\
             As light as a feather \\
            And dark as coal \\
            Quiet whispers \\
            Silent and still \\
            It's a part of your life \\
            Your purificationist will \\

        \begin{verse}
            A new way of writing \\
            Something once forgotten \\
            Something far lost \\
            And once was rotten \\
            Something so invincible \\
            That it was ignored \\
            It was like an unstable person \\
            With a powerless sword \\
            An inspirational tweak \\
            Finally a vibrant sound \\
            Finally a way to come back \\
            To what I once found \\
            A new way to look at it \\
            A whole new inspiration \\
            A new will to write \\
            A whole new temptation \\
            It's what I've been looking for \\
            I've walked so far \\
            Finally back on track \\
            Gazing at my star \\

            The Starshine of night \\
            Where blindness is covered \\
            By the moons blue light \\
            We ride together \\
            Throughout what ever brings \\
            Whoever may drag our bodies \\
            And whoever may pull our strings \\
            For in the brightness of dawn \\
            Out of the darkest night \\
            We have all fought \\
            And forever, we will fight \\
            For what ever future may come \\
            And whatever lies behind \\
            We forget our past \\
            And we dig to find \\
            Find new ways \\
            For an archeologist can't stop \\
            We ride into dawn \\
            We ride till we drop \\

            A lifetime of memories \\
            It's time to set them free \\
            It's time to show them all \\
            That there is more to see \\
            Set out to the wide ocean \\
            And let the wind blow \\
            Nothing has prepared me more \\
            Than the weakness that I show \\
            No more shall the light stand \\
            No longer shall I fear the road \\
            No longer shall I be pushed back \\
            No longer shall I lift the load \\
            Fear what I can fear \\
            And bring me to the sun \\
            To the moon and her light \\
            Until my testament is done \\
            But not only for the future \\
            But also for what has been \\
            For what can one lose \\
            If it's the only thing he's seen? \\
            If one simple dream \\
            Could only change my fate \\
            Then maybe it is time \\
            To say it's to late \\
            The innocent one \\
            It's time to let her know \\
            That she  has prepared battle \\
            That it's the only way to go \\
            No longer shall I worry \\
            No longer shall I fear \\
            For I will be free \\
            As long as I'm here \\

            The pain and torment \\
            That one cannot break free \\
            That of a gunfires shot \\
            Can change what can be \\
            Like a bullet at it's finest \\
            Soaring through the air \\
            Peaceful at it's tip \\
            But waging war and fear \\
            For what is a bullet, \\
            But another worrying fact? \\
            Because, what is a bullet, \\
            But a burtal killers pact? \\
            For the beholder of the bullet \\
            The gun that takes on it's own \\
            The one that brings might to power \\
            And leaves us all alone \\
            For fear can conquer, \\
            Over what we call peace \\
            For all it takes is a bullet \\
            And a person to release \\
            Fear over love \\
            But a bullet is all that it will take \\
            Fear can acomplish \\
            What other people fake \\

            We were made for this \\
            You and I \\
            There is no crossing us \\
            Just let them try! \\
            My soul reaches out \\
            And my mind turns around \\
            For time and space \\
            Gave us these bounds \\
            They chose us \\
            And I am never turning down \\
            As long as you see this face \\
            It will never wear a frown \\
            I will never give up \\
            As long as I have you at my side \\
            My wonderful blue flower \\
            You are my heart and pride \\

        \begin{verse}
            Reaching towards oblivion \\
            Looking up to the stars \\
            Hiding behind the bushes \\
            And closed behind the bars \\
            What may come to us \\
            And what should we do? \\
            How can we tell the differences \\
            Between me and you? \\
            For we aren't all the same \\
            We do not achieve the same goals \\
            We do not feel the same emotions \\
            We do not all have the same souls \\
            We all preach differently \\
            And to different signs \\
            Some of us even don't preach \\
            They hide behind blinds \\
            But should all be accepted \\
            Why should we not? \\
            Do we deserve less, \\
            If we are not part of the plot? \\
            Hiding  ehind obstacles \\
            Hidden in the blue use sky \\
            Every single Hello \\
            Will always end in a goodbye \\
            But that doesn't change the fact \\
            That a hello is worth a lifetime alone \\
            For  every step towards society \\
            Wakes a wiggle to the bone \\
            It makes us who we are \\
            And it tells us all apart \\
            For we are not a islands \\
            On a map you can chart \\
            No we all live individually \\
            And we should never live alike \\
            Once you learn to ride \\
            You will always know how to bike \\

            What good lies \\
            In looking to the past \\
            What good lies \\
            In thinking to fast \\
            How can it be so wrong \\
            When the past drags us in \\
            What good does it have \\
            When we are dragged within? \\
            Within our youth \\
            And our younger days \\
            For what does it other \\
            Than ask us for pays \\
            Pays of misfortune \\
            And not fortune on it's own \\
            For wealth and fortune \\
            Only leaves you alone \\
            Cold, heartless, \\
            And shivered in your past \\
            Wishing you could leave \\
            Change of your cast \\
            But do we go that way? \\
            Or can we stop this thing? \\
            Can we make this change \\
            And turn winter into spring? \\
            The clouds so purple \\
            Coloured by the sun \\
            For what we did \\
            Was chosen as it begun \\
            The purple, \\
            The ever ending skies \\
            Bringing us hope \\
            Hope to lovers eyes \\
            Because we beat on \\
            Like boats against the flow \\
            We travel where it tells us \\
            And we travel where it goes \\
            Borne back ceaselessly \\
            Borne back for ever, at last \\
            Borne back ceaselessly \\
            Into the past \\

            I have looked far \\
            I really have \\
            But sometimes \\
            I miss it all \\
            And everything seems lost \\
            Broken \\
            But it's not worth my return \\
            None of them deserve it \\
            Why should I care? \\
            Tell me! \\
            Tell me right now! \\
            If I've ever done it wrong \\
            I haven't \\
            And you know that well \\
            For that's what they all are \\
            A part of the purple skies \\
            Reaped within my memories \\
            Never to be let out \\
            And the surrounding \\
            The surrounding sounds and places \\
            The places I've been \\
            And never will return to \\
            That is what I have sworn \\
            My legacy and promise \\
            But every memory \\
            Is like a tree \\
            Small leaves falling down \\
            If there is enough room \\
            Enough trees \\
            And enough wind \\
            You will have the opportunity \\
            To catch one \\
            And sometimes they will catch you \\
            And you may stand by \\
            But it won't help \\
            For brick by brick \\
            You follow them with your eyes \\
            Can't look away \\
            Can't break away from the ropes \\
            That you have already sett up \\
            No turning back \\
            Not from this \\
            Not ever. \\

            It seems the night has come \\
            Laid across the land \\
            Looking back up at me \\
            And where I stand \\
            I look at the night \\
            It always looks back \\
            But once I have gotten a look \\
            There is always a crack \\
            A little bit of light \\
            Shining thought the dark \\
            While the wind blows the bushes \\
            Hidden in the park \\
            While I stand there \\
            Wondering about all \\
            Standing there while I'm risen \\
            As well as when I fall \\
            There is no other darkness \\
            Then the one filled with black \\
            For once one has take a step \\
            There is no turning back \\
            Going one way \\
            Stepping into the free \\
            Stepping into yourself \\
            While I step into me \\
            Going into the darkness \\
            It always feels good \\
            In a way I don't understand \\
            But it's not something I should \\
            I feel the bitterness \\
            As well as the sweat \\
            Stepping into something \\
            That you cannot retreat! \\
            Bittersweet taste \\
            And unforgivable me \\
            Setting my foot into darkness \\
            But into the free \\

        \begin{verse}
            Dirt and sand \\
            Gravelled up from the ground \\
            Not a noise to be heard \\
            Not a whisper, nor a sound \\
            Just the shovel \\
            The inevitable herds \\
            Of one mans wisdom \\
            Over another mans words \\
            At the brink of dawn \\
            In the night's darkest hour \\
            Upon the heavy rain \\
            That down upon him would shower \\
            The darkest of words \\
            Would come upon him that night \\
            That would bring him fear \\
            And opposites of delight \\
            It would strike him down \\
            And strip him of his glee \\
            Or what was left \\
            Of his dream of being free \\
            The words echoed through the night \\
            And the man fell to his knees \\
            He begged and he plead \\
            "Oh god help, please!" \\
            But one can't stop the inevitable \\
            His time had finally come \\
            The sound of his heart \\
            Mirrored the sound of the drum \\
            Now that all light is lost \\
            And the digging has come to an end \\
            It looks like we all \\
            Have come to lose a friend \\
            A grave, done by the shovel \\
            And the man fell to his doom \\
            To be burned In hell, Buried alive \\
            Dug, his own tomb \\

            For these things \\
            They terrorise the inner peace \\
            The monsters and their ways! \\
            Never giving you release! \\

            The lighting has been taken \\
            The fabric has been given away \\
            All that is left for you \\

            You want to tell them this \\

            What is left to tell? \\
            You don't want to say it \\
            You want their answers, \\
            Their methods! \\
            Their every caring thought \\

            A silver platter \\
            In which you can stay \\
            But commitments \\
            On which they cannot hold \\
            You want to remind them \\
            Of that one thing they did \\
            How come they can't see \\
            The obvious in front of them \\
            When they are looking through \\
            A simple glass wall \\
            We have to look through iron \\
            We have to listen light \\

            Lies the great trust \\
            But we have no tools \\
            We have nothing to spare \\
            We have only our hands \\
            Only one way forward \\
            The path that leads to nothing \\
            Forgiveness, and an end \\
            End you don't want to see \\

            Where our emotions fail \\
            Where our hearts do not belong \\
            Where the future is set \\
            By one simple song \\
            A tiny memory \\
            But a huge mistake made \\
            But worry not! \\
            The price has been payed \\
            But like all things \\
            They come back in sparks \\
            Leaving tears on our faces \\
            And our faces with marks \\
            Others cannot see it \\
            They think it all has passed \\
            But first thing first \\
            Somethings will last \\
            Not in a big way \\
            As I said they come and go \\
            But sometimes letting emotions back \\
            Is easier than letting them show \\
            Some poems stay \\
            Stay within my heart \\
            They won't go away \\
            Even after they part \\
            Scars will always be left \\
            And there is nothing we can do \\
            But a reminder for the creator \\
            And all he went through \\
            Let your emotions go \\
            Don't let others tear you apart \\
            For nothing will end \\
            Before a new start \\
            A song sings \\
            Within another song \\
            You can't tell it's similarities \\

        \begin{verse}
            What ever right \\
            You have upon me \\
            Is the right that I \\
            Will never see \\
            The right to tell \\
            And to be told \\
            For the fierce and nimble \\
            The careful and bold \\
            The truth. - One day \\
            It will be seen \\
            Care your eyes \\
            Wash them clean \\
            For all the ones \\
            Just like me \\
            Will be the ones \\
            To never see \\

        \begin{verse}
            On the rights of his attorney \\
            In his dark driven fist \\
            She searched for redemption \\
            Through the never ending mist \\
            She wasn't good enough \\
            She was so simple and plain \\
            And with the mahogany desk \\
            She held his restrain \\
            He didn't change his mind \\
            He was still destined for the cause \\
            Throughout the bumps and flail \\
            He changed the new laws \\
            He didn't define it as good \\
            But perfect more or less \\
            For with this accurate description \\
            He fought through the distress \\
            Prefect through the bad \\
            And perfect through the good \\
            Shaking of the dark fist \\
            And returning how it should \\
            Objection against the cliche \\
            And a hand against the old \\
            The way to tell a story \\
            And for this one to be told \\

        \poemtitle{The Full Moon Alchemist - I}
        \begin{verse}
            When all hope is lost \\
            When time stops at last \\
            When you can’t do other \\
            Than look back to your past \\
            What do you do? \\
            Once you have lost your mind \\
            When you can’t decide \\
            Whether they are bad or kind \\
            You look up \\
            And you pray for light \\
            For in eternal darkness \\
            There is no wrong or right \\
            The shining of the moon \\
            In it’s bright, greatest form \\
            Not a cloud to see \\
            Never broken by a storm \\
            All the stars \\
            Are all but unseen \\
            The light by the moon \\
            Make a person keen \\
            For what can this go about? \\
            What philosophies may it stun? \\
            For some can only dream \\
            While others are undone \\
            It all has an end \\
            In a light whistled guitar \\
            One final song \\
            For who ever you are \\
            The light fades away \\
            Over the short burst of time \\
            When it all ends \\
            In one, final rhyme \\

        \poemtitle{Bound Heart - II}
        \begin{verse}
            My heart will always stay bound \\
            To one singe thought \\
            The one person I would bring anywhere \\
            Without concern for what I brought \\
            A thought that came and stayed \\
            There was no deny \\
            The thought would stay in my heart \\
            No matter why \\
            There is no clue to how it happened \\
            But I guess that I fate \\
            And I will always be thankful \\
            For it not being to late \\
            Bringing me the horizon \\
            And setting the once ridden sun \\
            It has passed a year since \\
            My life had begun \\
            You are the thought \\
            You happy creature, you \\
            I know you love me \\
            And I love you too \\
            There’s just no boundaries \\
            To where our love will go \\
            Where it will end up \\
            Where we will show \\
            But I know one thing for sure \\
            There is no walking away \\
            There is no turning back \\
            For I will always stay \\
            With the one that sealed my heart \\
            The one that took my breath away \\
            The one that told my soul \\
            That it will be okey \\
            The one that doesn’t care for my past \\
            The one that sets my heart on fire \\
            The one that cares for me \\
            The one that brings all the joy \\
            The one that I can see \\
            Can see will be the greatest \\
            No wait, she is already \\
            It didn’t climb with caution \\
            And it didn’t wiggle steady \\
            You were there all the times I fell \\
            And you still are \\
            You are simply not just my heart \\
            You are also a star \\
            You are the brightest star \\
            In the sky tonight for me \\
            I am the one to sett you free \\
            Free from misery and suffering \\
            From drought and pain \\
            I just want you love \\
            I crave no gain \\
            For all I want \\
            Is our future and our time \\
            For you have all eternity \\
            To be the one to shine \\
            You always shine to my smile \\
            You always shine so bright \\
            But times without you \\
            Are times without light \\
            The times I don’t see you \\
            Are the ones I am alone \\
            But the ones filled with joy \\
            Saying I love you on the phone \\
            There is nothing I want more \\
            Than the love I receive from you \\
            There is nothing i want more \\
            Than to stay with you through \\
            I love you \\
            So much and never ending \\
            You are worth all the worlds spending \\

        \poemtitle{Bedroom - III}
        \begin{verse}
            I’ve been waiting for you in the bedroom \\
            Cause I’m waiting for you \\
            to come home \\
            I’ve been waiting to long I’ve lost track of time \\
            And I’m trying to find my way back \\
            I seem lost some times \\
            I seem free of mind \\
            But I’m set a new course \\
            and I follow the way to my goals \\
            When the darkness surrounds me \\
            And there’s nothing left to do \\
            And I find myself looking for me \\
            Yet another time anew \\
            I seem found by you \\
            I feel it flowing through \\
            But I’ve set a new course \\
            And I’m ready to continue on \\
            I find my course and I set \\
            But I can’t seem to find a new path \\
            That would leed me to good \\
            And away as a should \\
            But I keep walking on my way back \\
            I’ve been waiting for you \\
            Just so you could come home \\
            I’ve been waiting to long I’ve lost track of time \\
            And I’m trying to find my way back \\

        \poemtitle{Facade - IV}
        \begin{verse}
            Time on and time again \\
            I have tried \\
            But sometimes the elegance \\
            Is so hard to hide \\
            You can walk through the city \\
            Without an eye on you \\
            But the moment you step into me \\
            All the eyes will se through \\
            The fa¸cade that you try to pull \\
            And that you try to screw \\
            The one that probably can \\
            Pack a punch or two \\
            I’ve seen enough trouble to know \\
            Where this is going \\
            It’s not hard to see \\
            Your whole act I showing \\
            Drive a can \\
            Where I can walk \\
            I’ll sing your verse \\
            Don’t talk the talk \\
            Just drive away \\
            And ride my bike \\
            Where will I be \\
            The next time you strike \\
            Just one dance \\
            And I know all that I need \\
            No pages to flip \\
            Or books to read \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Read These Words - V}
        \begin{verse}
            It really just means I’m free \\
            Just stay away from the shadows \\
            And don’t speak their name \\
            For these things are wild \\
            Although they seem tame \\
            I might not see light again \\
            But at least I remember you \\
            I remember your face \\
            And how our relationship grew \\
            But now you must hurry \\
            Because I won’t last long \\
            You must keep on running for me \\
            And keep staying strong \\
            Just remember, \\
            Even though We’re apart \\
            I will always see the shadows \\
            That rip through your heart \\
            I will crush you little life \\
            And annihilate you soul \\
            And stab you every inch \\
            Until you’ll never be whole \\
            Die, burn and never come back \\
            The darkness has consumed this mind \\
            Restless, crude and pure evil \\
            This is how we unwind \\
            You are next, to also be free \\
            You are next, like all before \\
            You wl be slaughtered and killed \\
            And your body turned a whore \\
            No blood, no love \\
            No peace, no grace \\
            No body, no soul \\
            No teeth, no face \\
            A smile, a grin \\
            An unforgettable lough \\
            As the buzz saw comes closer \\
            And you are cut in half \\

        \begin{verse}
            This life is short \\
            There is nothing I can do \\
            But the time I spend \\
            I will spend with you \\
            Once the times come nigh, \\
            The beginning forms anew \\
            I see like then, as I do now \\
            That you are on of the few \\
            A poet is a poet \\
            But when it stops its done \\
            But the love for you makes this untrue \\
            You truly are the one \\
            I loved my life and broke my heart \\
            Long before your love \\
            But I always knew and trusted you \\
            That we would go above \\
            There’s so much to see and so much to do \\
            The only thing I hold \\
            Is truth be told, the once knew bold \\
            The fact that I’m with you \\
            I simply love all that is yours \\
            And everything inclined \\
            I’ll try to see and try to be \\
            What ever that we find. \\
            I’ll hold you true, my forever love \\
            I will never ever let go \\
            I’ll keep on trying, never be lying \\
            And give what you will show \\
            I love you so, I can’t let go \\
            My heart to you, \\
            The violin in the snow \\

        \poemtitle{Flashback - I}
        \begin{verse}
            As time goes \\
            You always seem to forget \\
            Not that you would want to change \\
            Nothing to regret \\
            You just forget \\
            As easy as so \\
            You forget where you came from \\
            And where to go \\
            But as soon as you remember \\
            What you didn’t before \\
            It’s easy to see \\
            What one thought of as lore \\
            You forgot your roots \\
            Your road of trial and fail \\
            Where you build your first boat \\
            And set sail \\
            Many a scenes \\
            Were to be seen \\
            And many islands on the way \\
            To fulfil your dream \\
            Want to be loved \\
            Want to be free \\
            Set out in a boat \\
            To sail you to me \\
            We can all forget our roots \\
            Where the adventure saw light \\
            We can all forget the beautiful feeling \\
            That once was so bright \\
            It still is bright \\
            But not in the same way \\
            The feeling is still here \\
            It will always stay \\
            The first kiss \\
            The first word \\
            Knowing there isn’t \\
            Anyone else in the world \\
            As the story unfolds \\
            There will be nothing left to send \\
            This story will always continue \\
            Because the blue flower will never end \\

            I never thought \\
            That this world could be so mean \\
            The rain is pouring down \\
            But not a cloud to be seen \\
            As for one last time \\
            We see his brown furry bush \\
            When we all wanted to stand still \\
            But all that came was a push \\
            A push to something \\
            That I never saw as true \\
            I never saw this happening \\
            Having to walk away from you \\
            Over 9 years \\
            It all seemed so much more \\
            We will never ever be as good \\
            As we once were before \\
            The soft voice says \\
            ”This is the only way” \\
            It is so hard to believe \\
            When I wish you could stay \\
            I will never forget you \\
            Best friend to me \\
            I will always remember you \\
            For I will never see \\
            Anything as pure and good \\
            As I know you can be \\
            Thought it seemed like I \\
            Was the only one to see \\
            The lonely soul \\
            The true side of you \\
            The one that was never shown \\
            But in the end was true \\
            You went through hell \\
            And we never knew how to ask \\
            We would just yell and yell \\
            But there was no easy task \\
            We all love you \\
            Especially I \\
            I cannot live without you \\
            And I don’t know why \\
            You brown, little fellow \\
            The perfect little friend \\
            I never knew how to be \\
            Prepared for the end \\
            I wish I could help \\
            Or at least that I could try \\
            We always seem to forget \\
            How hard it is to say goodbye \\

            Once again in the darkness \\
            The old friend of mine \\
            While the cold wind blows \\
            And the summer closes time \\
            The darkness is not evil \\
            I have never said it was \\
            It is more of a philosophy \\
            It is more of my ”because” \\
            The cold air is sizzling \\
            And the summer sun has faded \\
            We have done our last card game \\
            And we are all done with our bathing \\
            Soon we stand in the snow \\
            With our feet so wet \\
            Though this time anew \\
            We won’t feel regret \\
            At least I won’t \\
            And I have never seen it with you \\
            I will never feel regret \\
            The same way as few \\
            We stand in the cold air \\
            With the darkness all around \\
            We feel the pressure from the surrounding \\
            Our fates, ever bound \\
            I understood for a long time \\
            There is no longer I \\
            We are the ever lasting martyrs \\
            Who together touch the sky \\
            Once again in the darkness \\
            The poets enemy and friend \\
            We stand together through it \\
            Through ever bitter end \\

        \begin{verse}
            When I first walked into that place \\
            I thought my eyes were deceived \\
            I thought it could not be true \\
            Those things that I received \\
            Popularity, love, \\
            Care and friends \\
            It was the start of the beginning \\
            But to an inevitable end \\
            The power that I wanted \\
            And to all surprise, received, \\
            Would bring me to another world \\
            Or so long I believed \\
            I loved, I lost \\
            I dabbled and I fought \\
            But nothing could bring \\
            More peace than I thought \\
            What I wanted so bad \\
            Turned against me one day \\
            And when that time came \\
            I decided to walk away \\
            And I may have left the building \\
            And I may have left that phase \\
            But nothing can stop that desire \\
            And keeping it at place \\

        \begin{verse}
            If only words could fill my mouth \\
            As I write these words for you \\
            The only thing I can guarantee \\
            Is that all I say is true \\
            A pretty odd story \\
            Of a boy lost in the city \\
            All he wanted was to be loved \\
            To be free \\
            But when the December morning \\
            Turned to him to say: \\
            ”No longer shall you suffer \\
            No longer shall you pay! \\
            I offer you a deal \\
            One to make you happy and proud \\
            One to rid you of your sorrows \\
            And make you feel out loud! \\
            All you must do \\
            Is give me your word, \\
            Give me your poems, \\
            And all you ever heard! \\
            I will give you your love \\
            But you must stay strong \\
            Because this time if she leaves you \\
            There is nothing left, but wrong!” \\
            He nodded to the deal \\
            Without further ado \\
            The voice clapped his hands \\
            And the pack was made true \\
            The boy now had to search \\
            For the one he was promised in the end \\
            But she never came \\
            And his time he had to spend \\
            He looked everywhere \\
            And all around \\
            But the girl he was promised \\
            Was never to be found \\
            Until one day, \\
            When he thought all hope was lost \\
            The fist day he had stopped looking \\
            And the day he didn’t pay the cost \\
            She way found \\
            Where anyone could be \\
            But he knew it was her \\
            Because he now could see \\
            For whenever you are looking for love \\
            It can never be found \\
            But the moment you stop your search \\
            You finally realise, \\
            Love is all around \\

        \begin{verse}
            Time on and time again \\
            I have tried \\
            But sometimes the elegance \\
            Is so hard to hide \\
            You can walk through the city \\
            Without an eye on you \\
            But the moment you step into me \\
            All the eyes will se through \\
            The fa¸cade that you try to pull \\
            And that you try to screw \\
            The one that probably can \\
            Pack a punch or two \\
            I’ve seen enough trouble to know \\
            Where this thing is going \\
            It’s not hard to see \\
            Your whole act I showing \\
            Drive a can \\
            Where I can walk \\
            I’ll sing your verse \\
            Don’t talk the talk \\
            Just drive away \\
            And ride my bike \\
            Where will I be \\
            The next time you strike \\
            Just one dance \\
            And I know all that I need \\
            No pages to flip \\
            Or books to read \\
            Just dance with me \\
            Follow my beat \\
            Take a step \\
            And feel the heat \\
            Throw me closer \\
            And take my tip \\
            From that margarita \\
            From which you sip \\
            Just dance with me \\
            Till the night falls flat \\
            But that will never happen \\
            As long as I tip my hat \\

        \begin{verse}
            As you read these words \\
            The wind may have taken me \\
            While this might seem terrible \\
            It really just means I’m free \\
            Just stay away from the shadows \\
            And don’t speak their name \\
            For these things are wild \\
            Although they seem tame \\
            I might not see light again \\
            But at least I remember you \\
            I remember your face \\
            And how our relationship grew \\
            But now you must hurry \\
            Because I won’t last long \\
            You must keep on running for me \\
            And keep staying strong \\
            Just remember, \\
            Even though We’re apart \\
            I will always see the shadows \\
            That rip through your heart \\
            I will crush you little life \\
            And annihilate you soul \\
            And stab you every inch \\
            Until you’ll never be whole \\
            Die, burn and never come back \\
            The darkness has consumed this mind \\
            Restless, crude and pure evil \\
            This is how we unwind \\
            You are next, to also be free \\
            You are next, like all before \\
            You will be slaughtered and killed \\
            And your body turned a whore \\
            No blood, no love \\
            No peace, no grace \\
            No body, no soul \\
            No teeth, no face \\
            A smile, a grin \\
            An unforgettable lough \\
            As the buzz saw comes closer \\
            And you are cut in half \\

        \begin{verse}
            The window is cracked \\
            There’s still writing on the wall \\
            Just to show myself \\
            No to show them all \\
            The roses drown \\
            In the ever lasting rain \\
            While you keep dancing \\
            In my symphony of pain \\
            There’s no truth \\
            No solution, no grip \\
            There’s only this dream \\
            Of landing at the tip \\
            This surreal dream \\
            Of never ending grief \\
            While the single reason \\
            Is never a relief \\
            There are no songs \\
            No poets, no blame \\
            There is just this fantasy \\
            That we are all the same \\
            We don’t survive to live \\
            We don’t live to die \\
            The only reason why we never stop \\
            Is that we don’t ever try \\
            So why haven’t it stopped \\
            The dream, the songs, the end \\
            Why must my worst enemy \\
            Also be my friend \\
            There are no remedies \\
            Of the ”great” old day \\
            There are the paths we chose to take \\
            And the ones that are in our way \\
            But can we ever know \\
            What path was ours to take \\
            When all we know is nothing \\
            Compared to what’s at stake \\
            There are no poets now \\
            Not then, not anymore \\
            Because the ones that are poets now \\
            We were never poets before \\

            Placing a smile \\
            At the perfect event \\
            Making me forget \\
            Everything I resent \\
            Like a smile \\
            On a young boys face \\
            Or the thing \\
            You once called grace \\
            You never really forget \\
            Your first broken bone \\
            It sticks to your heart \\
            Like a cold, sharp stone \\
            I never imagined \\
            Feeling this way \\
            But people and events \\
            They seem to stay \\
            So while I tend to the dead \\
            And make the flowers bloom \\
            While I row my boat \\
            Through the everlasting loom \\
            I stitch up the lies \\
            Told by a previous face \\
            And I must cover the horror \\
            And unfathomable disgrace \\
            It hurts, still \\
            I will never forget \\
            But the end draws near \\
            And I have nothing to regret \\
            Other than the poems I wrote \\
            And the images I’ve seen \\
            I’ve done it all \\
            Just to prove my scene \\
            I have high hopes \\
            For the future, tomorrow and today \\
            Everything I do from now on \\
            Will be a delight to say \\
            So while my vices rack up \\
            And my virtues never do \\
            I will forever be content \\
            Because of all of you \\

            While we can forever talk \\
            About love, loss and vain \\
            But we must not forget \\
            The light within the pain \\
            The air inside the balloon \\
            The mastery within the flaw \\
            The writing on the wall \\
            The talking without a jaw \\
            We forget the truth \\
            Or at least we hide \\
            But why should we do this \\
            When there is so much to pride \\
            Pride within our actions \\
            And pride within my own \\
            Pride for people I’ve helped \\
            The magnificent milestone \\
            Pride for the virtue of life \\
            And living as of forever \\
            Pride to keep on going \\
            And giving up, never \\
            Pride in integrity \\
            But never flawless as per say \\
            Pride in the sunlight \\
            Brought in everyday \\
            I Pride myself of many things \\
            But not of them all \\
            For the chaos and the calm \\
            Would seem to be my fall \\
            When the world gets to heavy \\
            Put it on my pride \\

            When your heart pumps \\
            To a beat already known \\
            When your footsteps crack \\
            In the pavement all alone \\
            You can feel the chaos \\
            The chaos rising in \\
            I can feel the end \\
            Coming from within \\
            I can feel my past \\
            Drift away from my soul \\
            Achieving, finally \\
            My ultimate goal \\
            But the chaos keeps me at bay \\
            It makes me go insane \\
            I can try to hide it all I want \\
            But the poems are to blame \\
            The calm is a nice thought \\
            The calm comes from within \\
            It tells me when it is time \\
            For me to inevitably begin \\
            A journey to find myself \\
            My soul and you \\
            So that I can begin to imagine \\
            What I can do with the two \\
            The chaos and the calm \\
            The wind and the sun \\
            The cold, the warm \\
            And the feeling like I’m done \\
            It’s so far away in time \\
            It makes me so stressed \\
            It is so wonderful \\
            I sometimes feel blessed \\
            It is driving me insane \\
            I cannot think anew \\
            All this memorising \\
            Makes all my actions blue \\
            But the end is very close \\
            And so is the chaos I feel on me \\
            Let the calm come and let me feel \\
            So that I, for once, can be free \\

            The picture painted so precise, \\
            And the book, written in bold \\
            Tell me again \\
            Who I am to be \\
            The death of a poet? \\
            Or the death of me? \\
            I Am certainly uncertain \\
            About the future of this task \\
            ”Wear the clothes, wear the hat \\
            And don’t forget that mask” \\
            So while the books and photos \\
            Once again they resurface \\
            I do believe they did so \\
            With a purpose \\
            So maybe if I draw a kaleidoscope \\
            Maybe if I listen to the song \\
            I might actually learn again \\
            And have to wait so long \\
            Unorthodox and wierd \\
            And maybe even strange \\
            Sing a new verse for the people \\
            And a new way to arrange \\
            A new greeting and a fame \\
            A new thought and a new stage \\
            A new song, i might listen \\
            A new poem, a new page \\
            As The death of my poet \\
            And The rebirth of my inner own \\
            I see the way I used to be \\
            And the reason we’re alone \\
            So while the last word is pain \\
            The first ever is flower \\
            While I die a death \\
            I can never cower \\
            So that The Flower of Life \\
            Can ever bloom \\
            While I reach \\
            My inevitable doom \\
            Stitch is gone, \\
            The only thing I had \\
            It is awfully happy \\
            Though it might seem sad \\
            Denzen, please forgive me, \\
            I leave with great prevail \\
            I win this game of poetry \\
            To live as normal male \\
            I watched this flower die \\
            It is past it’s due \\
            With words, shorter than short \\
            With petals, fewer than few \\
            So while some flowers are small \\
            And some bloom more \\
            I look up to the sky \\
            And I see the end \\

        \begin{verse}
            I see the darkness \\
            I wake my eyes \\
            I have risen to nothing \\
            And by nothing to my surprise \\
            I can taste the love \\
            All around my soul \\
            Around my womb \\
            And everything as a whole \\
            My train of thought Tracks into the abyss \\
            And I long for something, \\
            My first friend and last kiss \\
            Tell me, father, \\
            What I am to be \\
            When all I feel is darkness \\
            All around me \\

            As an unexpected burden \\
            As an unexpected treat \\
            I was created to serve both \\
            My master and my fleet \\
            A city of evil \\
            And a town lost of hope \\
            A city; ridden with snow \\
            And a place unable to cope \\
            A boy loves his life in peace \\
            And a girl follows her pace \\
            He begins to wonder \\
            Where to this would take place \\
            Into the darkness, \\
            For the two sparks of joy \\
            That thought no evil, \\
            And could not destroy \\
            Build their love, \\
            Craft their time \\
            In an impossible universe \\
            So dark and sublime \\

            And I have felt it in my heart \\
            That both my makers \\
            Have now been torn apart \\
            None of them of choice \\
            And none of them of hate \\
            But not out of joy \\
            And not because it’s great \\
            I feel my time is of the essence \\
            And my life is so much \\
            I feel so hopeful \\
            And so very in touch \\
            But at the same time \\
            I struggle to feel safe \\
            From what ever comes to be \\
            What ever happens to them \\
            Will also happen to me \\

            I will love you, \\
            Honestly and fair \\
            For you will be mine \\
            And you will do great \\
            I can feel it in my heart \\
            I can chase away the hate \\
            I told them about you, \\
            Yes, I told them all \\
            For I did not care \\
            I could stand the fall \\
            As the city calls for me \\
            And asks for my aid \\
            I have to obey \\
            I have to fade \\
            Into nothingness \\
            And into everything \\
            I need not all of you \\
            For some things, I cannot bring \\
            My past, my present \\

            I will bring them all \\
            Until my very end \\
            My city calls \\
            As does the created \\
            Nothing will ever be like this \\
            For it has never been debated \\
            Faded into time \\
            And added into me \\
            I see the light shimmering \\
            I can see it set me free \\

            While the darkness consumes me \\
            I can sense a presence now, \\
            Of something different and new \\
            I can feel it, but I don’t know how \\
            A building fear, strange sensation, \\
            A miracle, a nirvana \\
            An extreme relaxation \\
            A city forms \\
            In front of my very eyes \\
            ’The City of Agartha: \\
            A town that never lies’ \\
            A jolly looking sign \\
            Just suddenly there \\
            I could barely see nothing \\
            Now I see clear \\
            Males, and females \\
            Their nature reptilian \\
            Creatures, but not beasts \\
            People, but brilliant \\
            What are these visions \\
            In my imaginary dreams \\
            Are they but hollow fragments \\
            Of my never-ending screams? \\
            I will continue \\
            This forsaken fortune of a friend \\
            Although with no idea where to go \\
            I already know the end \\

            There will always be someone \\
            And something that cries \\
            There will always be treachery, \\
            Foolishness and lies \\
            There will always be anger \\
            There will always be blood \\
            There will always be people \\
            But there will also be a flood \\
            I know this for a fact, \\
            For I have loved it on my own \\
            I have seen the mountains of sorrow \\
            And I have walked the path alone \\
            Though now by fortune, \\
            But by choice \\
            I hear the horrible people \\
            Screaming with their voice \\
            ’What a horrible person’ \\
            ’What and insufferable skank!’ \\
            I guess I have no one else \\
            But myself to thank \\
            So when you ask me these questions, \\
            I don’t want to reply \\
            I want to stay silent \\
            When you keep asking why \\
            I don’t want to tell you \\
            And I don’t want to know \\
            How we both can love her \\
            And how our relationship can grow \\

            These people tell me of their secrets \\
            They scourge me with their thought \\
            ’Please help us build it again!’ \\
            They tell me with their plots \\
            I tell them there is no reason \\
            This is all in my dreams! \\
            But they never listen \\
            Of so it seams \\
            They keep telling me of Agartha \\
            The newfound City of hope \\
            For the people cannot find love, \\
            But neither can find rope \\
            To climb their self esteem \\
            To overcome their ego selves \\
            To pack their bags and go ahead \\
            Remove it from their shelves \\
            They tell me I’m loved \\
            But the outside gods \\
            They never tell me who they are \\
            And they never tell me the odds \\
            I ask them and ask them \\
            But all they do are avoid \\
            They say the impact of the answer \\
            Is compared to a meteoroid \\
            The journey never ends \\
            Although it feels as so \\
            As long as my will goes on \\
            I will continue to go \\

            I tell him Its not that easy \\
            I tell him I’ll keep trying \\
            I tell him my dreams are greasy \\
            They tend to slip away \\
            And come back when I do not need \\
            I ask him what to do, \\
            But all I do is bleed \\
            My emotions bleed out \\
            And my mind withers away \\
            I can tell by the way she smiles \\
            That this is not the way it stays \\
            I can tell from the sadness \\
            Hidden deep in her eye \\
            That she is the reason \\
            I will never feel the sky \\
            The sky of the city \\
            Deep in my mind \\
            The dreams I don’t remember \\
            Where there is nothing to find \\
            I think I’m going crazy \\
            I think I need a break \\
            She’s moving away now anyway \\
            Moving to the lake \\
            But not across the street \\
            Across the land we know \\
            She’s going so far \\
            That I can never go \\
            I will see her though \\
            The one last time she smiled \\
            The point in the future \\
            Where she gives birth to our child \\

            All I felt was pain \\
            Even thought in the darkest hour \\
            I could feel it again \\
            The last drop of hope \\
            The love that comes for me \\
            The only thing to guide my quest \\
            And the on thing I see \\
            My name will be my passion \\
            As it is the only thing I need \\
            It will come with me while I win \\
            And it will stay with me while I bleed \\
            My name will stay with me forever \\
            And I hope it stays with you \\

            I clench my hand
            Unable to let go
            I want to say I’m sorry
            I want to wave goodbye
            The snow crumples between my feet

            Why am I blessed with this feeling?
            Unable to be alone

            An unanswered ”while” \\
            The time stops once, \\
            And resumes all the more \\
            Bringing legends, fables \\
            A bastard, and a whore \\
            King of a story \\
            Written by a queen \\
            He trots the even battleground \\
            His braveness, lines, between \\
            He sleeps in a bed \\
            Riddled with filthy lies \\
            Of a former life and prodigy \\
            And a love forgot and disguised \\
            A little green, a little red \\
            Some yellow and some blue \\
            He paints a picture of lies \\
            With words spoken true \\
            He lies beneath a broken lamp \\
            A light flickering blind \\
            While waiting now, forever still \\
            Until he falls behind \\
            It’s not a girl, nor blizzard \\
            Nor a book, nor a train \\
            It’s the sadness blooming \\
            While forever standing in the rain \\
            A heartbreaking slow \\
            Friends standing by \\
            The regal crown, however as fine \\
            Can never, ever die \\
            A hope and a dream \\
            That I never seem to learn \\
            For once I stop and give it up \\
            For more, I yearn \\
            At the end of an era, I once again stand \\
            Once again I’m blind \\
            I must face what comes, with faith \\
            A future, I must find \\

            Can’t bring myself to say \\
            Time passes on \\
            But I’m still here \\
            Lacking what I lost before \\
            Realizing it was never there \\

        \poemtitle{The White Fern - V}
        \begin{verse}
            A simple white fern \\
            Glowing in the dark \\
            Shining bright, a new light \\
            A diamond cut, a spark \\
            I want to know the reach of you \\
            And your everlasting smile \\
            Teach me what I must do \\
            To make it worth your while \\
            I want you to be the new \\
            I want you to know \\
            The reach of poems and of me \\
            To speak of you in the snow \\
            You are an addition to the cause \\
            A new line for sure \\
            I want to know what you can bring \\
            And I want to be sure \\
            A tale retold a million times \\
            A number 6 in a list of 4 \\
            I didn’t know then \\
            But I do know now \\
            The list is no more \\
            A castle set in cobblestone \\
            A bright light above \\
            I want to learn a new song \\
            A new song about love \\

        \poemtitle{Justiﬁcation - VI}
        \begin{verse}
            With an odd scent in the air
            I recollect this very day
            I remember a certain choice
            I try to get away
            I concern myself with anguish
            But, what is there to fear?
            The truth of the matter?
            A guy with purple hair
            I sit here wondering
            How this came to be
            Not the colouring or the image
            But the fact that I’m free
            Freedom entails a choice
            And freedom promises peace
            It provides me with a sense of passion
            But gives me no relief
            Was I free to do what I want?
            Was I happy in my misery?
            Does this freedom come with perks?
            Was I content with captivity?
            I yearn for more
            But all I want is my past
            The one thing that was forever
            The one thing that didn’t last
            It puts me into place
            I am happy this way
            I just can’t find peace
            Until this goes away
            With a familiar light
            That I recollect this day
            Feel the passion for tomorrow
            Slowly fade away

        \poemtitle{Restoration - VII}
        \begin{verse}
            Teaching and learning \\
            Deciding what is best for me \\
            Traversing the land of the greater \\
            And the land of the free \\
            Deciding my future \\
            Based on a fickle act \\
            Giving up all hope \\
            Relying on a false fact \\
            Revisiting a pain \\
            Something I used to know \\
            Learning from experiences \\
            But deciding not to grow \\
            Stuck in a stupid dream \\
            A sickness without medication \\
            Falling down from a blow \\
            But relying on a restoration \\
            A growing pain \\
            A loneliness without a scale \\
            My life grows week \\
            And my skin grows pale \\
            I need this purification \\
            My thoughts and my actions alone \\
            I need to feel safe again \\
            Trapped, without a home \\
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{Sensation - VIII}
        \begin{verse}
            Something weird and honest \\
            Akin to something new \\
            A though of something different \\
            And that different was you \\
            Married to a single time \\
            Unable to see ahead \\
            A thought that hits right at home \\
            Waking up, or going to bed \\
            A toxic feeling passion \\
            A tunnel visioned dream \\
            Going up against the current \\
            But falling down the stream \\
            An uninterested world \\
            An unaverted gaze \\
            Unable to move forward \\
            In this love inspired maze \\
            I cling to this feeling \\
            Of a solitude that true \\
            A thought of something honest \\
            And at the end there’s you \\

        \poemtitle{Fluctuation - IX}
        \begin{verse}
            They say people memorize their future \\
            But what is there to see? \\
            A bleak thought, a sad dream \\
            A depression waiting to be \\
            I see new colours today \\
            Ones I’ve grown to forget \\
            Some paint a quaint picture \\
            Others remind regret \\
            A deaf man can’t hear the sound \\
            The most marvelous sound of all \\
            But he can tell when you need him \\
            He can save you when you fall \\
            My future acts a calendar \\
            Nothing more, nothing less \\
            There is nothing on the horizon \\
            No one there to impress \\
            My heart yearns for its place \\
            One it used to know \\
            I have to follow its dreams \\
            But I cannot let it go \\
            It will be lost when I need it \\
            It will be found all too late \\
            I want to say that it’s all me \\
            But I know that’s not my fate. \\

        \poemtitle{Desperation - X}
        \begin{verse}
            Do I look lonely?
            Have you seen me like this before? \\
            Is it the cold wind outside \\
            Is it the unbearable chore \\
            Is it the rerun of a differed year \\
            The retelling the told \\
            Is it me crying for help \\
            Or is this growing old? \\
            Do I really believe in the future \\
            And the people wrapped all through \\
            Is there a reason for these emotions \\
            Give me some gold for this blue \\
            I reach for something simple \\
            But settle for complex \\
            Denying happiness \\
            And forcing me to digress \\
            I live in a utopian dream \\
            A fantasy of sorts \\
            Lasting too long \\
            But always too short \\
            I beg for something different \\
            But require the faithful blue \\
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Damnation - XI}
        \begin{verse}
            Throughs seem to drag my mind \\
            Every moonlight hour \\
            Never thinking about my next sleep \\
            The next number, or my next shower \\
            I fall asleep to the same old thoughts \\
            I dream the same old dreams \\
            I can hear the daybreak \\
            As I see the sunlight gleams \\
            I am left alone in my own bed \\
            Hiding dreams within my thought \\
            Never asking what I was thinking \\
            Never questioning what I saught \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Superﬂuoulation - XII}
        \begin{verse}
            Deciding who I am \\
            Based solely on an unknown fact \\
            Feeling melancholy and disgust \\
            Solely based on how you react \\
            I still live in a dream \\
            With all I want to be true \\
            I’ve seen this day, I’ve lived this night \\
            And I have thought it all through \\
            I know not what you want \\
            I only know of your greed \\
            But I need salvation from this curse \\
            I want to be freed \\
            Your words mean nothing to me \\
            Your actions amount to all \\
            I could be told what I was told before \\
            But it would simply stall \\
            You must defy what you do \\
            And I must be allowed to leave \\
            You will be required to sacrifice \\
            And I will be allowed to grieve \\
            Sounds ominous \\
            Desperate, but clear \\
            I have no dreams, no emotion \\
            Just time to spare \\

            Living peaceful \\

        \begin{verse}
            I didn’t think of you \\
            I slept well last night \\
            No early waking sounds \\
            Just the sun shining bright \\
            I felt a great weight on my chest \\
            When I tried to rise from bed \\
            ”no worries,” I told myself \\
            ”I’ll sleep some more instead” \\
            As I drifted off to unwavering rest \\
            My mind took an alternate route \\
            It was too late for the whimpering sound \\
            Desperately trying to be a shout \\
            When in the dream I awoke \\
            The sun was blazing hot \\
            There was no sadness, no worries \\
            A great deal of water, but not a lot \\
            As my body relaxed \\
            I wanted to dream more \\
            But there was a thing \\
            That would haunt me more \\
            A text message \\
            Creeps into my phone \\
            ”Hello, how are you?” \\
            ”are you currently home?” \\

            Make me a slave \\
            Of my own desire \\
            Make me keep \\
            The things I require \\
            Stall me, stall me \\
            I’m all in \\

            Please stop. I won’t tell you once more \\
            Your words tell a future \\
            But you act such a bore \\
            I’ve tried to speak up \\
            But you know that’s not my right \\
            I cower beneath your attention \\
            And answer to your light \\
            So just stop this \\
            You must do the deed \\
            You must break this curse of mine \\
            So that I can also be freed \\
            It hurts me \\
            A great deal too \\
            I thought we were done \\
            And that we were through \\
            But you come running back \\
            To pick up my hand \\
            And leave me in a moments notice \\
            Alone, where I stand. \\
            There is no virtue to your actions \\
            There is nothing I can do \\

            I’ve smelled this air before \\
            I’ve listened to this very song \\
            I’ve kissed these very lips \\
            As I remember something from before \\
            It cannot be the smell \\
            Not the people, not the sound \\
            It’s written in the walls \\
            It’s clinging all around \\
            I sense an ominous air \\
            As I write words written in the past \\
            I remember back to the days of black \\
            A prophecy to make it last \\
            I dread this very feeling \\
            As it feels too good \\
            The ominous wind \\
            Does not stand where I stood \\
            This girl of a grand entrance \\
            A girl with a smile so wide \\
            A person, a new interest \\
            My love, impossible to hide \\
            A passion and an insecurity \\
            A hope and a lie \\

            You were sitting right next to me \\
            But your presence was far away \\
            You whispered in my ear \\
            I whispered in yours too \\
            At any chance I had to look \\
            I would look up at you \\
            Watch you smile as your focus shifted \\
            Look away when you glared back \\
            A lot to take in without wonder \\
            And one day I will stop keeping track \\
            I want to be loved \\

            Can’t fight against the youth \\
            Can’t reach for the moon \\
            Never going to take them \\
            At least, not this soon \\
            A sweet symphony \\
            Of death, hate, love and war \\
            One more barrier to be broken \\
            Something else in store \\
            One new, again \\
            A repeat in time \\
            A wish so faithful \\
            A dream so sublime \\
            She entered once before \\
            A fated day \\
            Leaving too early, \\
            But wanting to stay \\
            I can remember \\
            The words she played \\
            Dipping up and down my ears \\
            Slightly positive, but delayed \\
            In an instant our eyes locked \\
            And our time stopped for all \\
            And until our gaze shifted \\
            She had only one person to stall \\
            I thought I was too old to feel \\
            This ever feeling once more \\
            As I thought I was \\
            Quite too youthful before \\
            She rests her head on my shoulder \\
            Whispering the truth \\
            I smiled, lifted myself and said \\
            Can’t fight against the youth \\

            You can’t imagine a path \\
            That she has yet to cross \\
            But you can’t foresee a future \\
            Without imagining loss \\
            She can’t seem \\
            To take the subtle hint \\
            And you can’t seem \\
            To read the fine print \\
            Is it something that I said \\
            Is it real, is it true \\
            I’ll try again tomorrow \\
            Is it me, is it you \\
            You’ve got her thinking \\

            Awaiting in anticipation \\
            For the truth I seek \\
            Is not meant for men like me \\
            I must keep waiting \\
            Calm, collected, but regrettably \\
            In the age of death \\
            For the summer, winter all the same \\
            She gives me no signage \\
            She leaves me in this game \\
            I know the rules \\
            I’ve played in the past \\
            I don’t seek assistance \\
            Just the pace to be fast \\
            The early rounds \\
            Cling to things known \\
            I suffer in anxiety \\
            Without your face shown \\

        \poemtitle{The Lake of Shadows - XXIII}
        \begin{verse}
            A heat emerged \\
            From beneath the depths \\
            Breaking water, from ice \\
            Marble, of the steps \\
            It fills the room \\
            Chaotic in its way \\
            Came, to procure death \\
            Stayed, just to play \\
            A vibrant ringing sound \\
            A distant spark, a flare \\
            A deep void, lingering \\
            Four eyes, bound to stare \\
            Locked within a state of panic \\
            Frantic in the way I look \\
            A distant path, a new future \\
            Something within that she took \\
            A nymph, but a hydra \\
            Cut one off, it grows anew \\
            A head made of many \\
            But a soul made for few \\
            My heart lingers within the song \\
            My lungs fill with remorse \\
            I’ve led you right to me \\
            And my life has run its course \\
            I can see the water rising \\
            As I’m drowned in a sea of hate \\
            It seems I’m doomed in this life \\
            Sealed by my own fate \\
            The water lingers on \\
            As I’m dowsed once more \\
            It seems it’s here to torture now \\
            Or was it like that before? \\
            A bright blue flower \\
            Emerges from the grave \\
            I know what I have lost \\
            I can see what I couldn’t save \\

        \begin{verse}
            I can sacrifice this freedom \\
            A youth, most willing to grow \\
            A sweet love, though birthed \\
            May traverse ever slow \\
            While time is of the essence \\
            And most are gone by night \\
            I live in a dream, effortlessly \\
            Parading in your delight \\
            A swift closure of a fear \\
            I can feel it looming in \\
            Your passion for a life worth living \\
            Draining me, silently from within \\
            But I smell sweat nectar, \\
            Love within the hives \\
            Breaking new ground, for me and you \\
            Wishing only, to live our lives \\
            But soon you leave me \\
            Or so I fear and dread \\
            I hope, of course, the best for you \\
            But I hope you stay instead \\
            But I can live in sadness \\
            A thousand miles apart \\
            Because you, and your precious smile \\
            Is worth a broken heart \\

        \begin{verse}
            We pillow our thoughts \\
            As a new day is planned \\
            We dare to look back and encourage us \\
            And where we stand \\
            Three shots in the chamber \\
            One missed and one bled \\
            One dragging on, ever through \\
            The young partners head \\
            A heart filled with sorrow \\
            And a heart filled with joy \\
            One breathless acolyte \\
            And one silent boy \\
            As the air grew quiet \\
            And a ringing came through \\
            It came, and overcame \\
            As the ringing sound grew \\
            It turned to pain, remorse \\
            Guilt and dispair \\
            No worry through the night \\
            Four eyes, bound to stare \\
            No pillows, No truth, \\
            No anger, no roaches \\
            Just a weeping sunrise \\
            As a red death approaches \\

        \begin{verse}
            Before you go \\
            There is one last thing \\
            Within all our conversations \\
            A thin red string \\
            In the way you smile \\
            In the way you talk \\
            In the way we speak \\
            And the way you walk \\
            We deliver an uncertainty \\
            In our every move \\
            As we dance in daylight \\
            An uncomfortable groove \\
            But I have one last wish \\
            Before I lose you too \\
            I want to you belive in me \\
            And myself through and through \\
            I have one last wish \\
            For you to live in glee \\
            I want you to live happily \\
            And that’s without me \\

            There are many things \\
            Studded to the crown \\
            A deep lore, a distand future \\
            A dress and a gown \\
            There are buttons \\
            Studded on a dress \\
            There are people living \\
            In constant regress \\
            I dare to move forward \\
            And to place the crown atop \\
            I dare to gase, throughout the haze \\
            To see them all drop \\
            But I do not dare \\
            To tread this new land \\
            I do not dare tp place it \\
            Upon my cursed hand \\
            I fear bad things \\
            For a great tomorrow \\
            As a rare ruby jewel \\
            Within my crown of sorrow \\

            Inside my mind \\
            Are just the dreams \\
            I left behind \\
            Left to rot \\
            In a ballad of time \\
            Singing it’s song \\
            The Infinite rhyme \\
            With sun kissed skin \\
            And a body that is sore \\
            With a person that I miss \\
            But do not yearn anymore \\
            Don’t teach me of regret \\
            You just didn’t care \\
            Returning the favour \\
            Of a casual affair \\

        \poemtitle{Chamber of Starlight - XXIX}
        \begin{verse}
            I sit again and wonder \\
            What ever came to be \\
            The last time i contemplated \\
            Who you were to me \\
            All I could see was the sunshine \\
            Clogged by the air of malice \\
            A sweet taste of free life \\
            Like red wine from my chalice \\
            But as the wine molded \\
            And swiftly turned to dust \\
            I reach for a golden goblet \\
            Filthy, covered in rust \\
            As the money lost momentum \\
            Bills were piling fast \\
            I sit here in resignation \\
            This time, like the last \\
            It’s hard to imagine tomorrow \\
            When yesterday was fine \\
            It’s hard to greet each new day \\
            When dust remains of wine \\
            It’s hard to fathom tomorrow \\
            In any form or way \\
            When last week was brighter \\
            Than it will ever be today \\

        \poemtitle{Desolation - XXX}
        \begin{verse}
            A renessance of emotions \\
            To myself, that I have told \\
            These things that should not exist \\
            But written in highlighted bold \\
            But one can’t seem to forget \\
            And dismantle the futile act \\
            As they said we deal with what we see \\
            And counter with how we react \\
            There are grounds for these emotions \\
            Sure, but are there any more? \\
            Is this a dent in the ceiling \\
            Or is it a speck on the floor? \\
            Is it one with the Forrest, \\
            The lake and the bliss? \\
            Is it a good day handshake \\
            Or a goodbye kiss? \\
            As the land within it grows \\
            And the places find their fit \\
            We miss the barren wastelands \\
            And forget them, bit by bit \\
            I design, forge and rearange \\
            Within the song of fate \\
            I find love and comfort, peace and prosperity \\
            Desolation, carelessness and hate \\

            Who knew what I could lose \\
            Just to say who wins \\
            I have a freedom from love \\
            But an abundance of regret \\

        \begin{verse}
            In a time
            Where no one could be seen \\
            Looking through the lines \\
            Behind, Over, and between \\
            In a time where feelings differ \\
            In a time in a foreign land \\
            I stay, to try to hide away \\
            For a reason I do not understand \\
            I still dream of your name \\
            And I still mourn my mistake \\
            I feel entitled to you \\
            As I dows myself in your lake \\
            I am free to do what I want \\
            I am tortured by this fact \\
            I don’t know how to live my life \\
            Living in the shadow of this act \\
            I can’t belive I’m sitting here \\
            Wallowing in my own regret \\
            Desperately trying to remember \\
            The reason I have to forget \\
            I want to leave for someone else \\
            But your smile stands in my way \\
            And in a way it feels the same \\
            My life is still so gray \\
            Please, water spirit \\
            Blue flower, all the same \\
            I want to see you smile again \\
            I want to take the blame \\
            I still see you in the night sky \\
            Everytime I fall asleep \\
            Sometimes I see you when I laugh \\
            But always when I weep \\

            If the past wondered closer \\
            And I’d see through me \\
            And I could taste the bittersweet \\
            That I have grown to know \\
            And I would enrich my wonder \\
            And teach myself to grow \\
            I would be an adult \\
            In a past of a little man \\
            I could try to be seen as this \\
            And I could try to understand \\
            In such a past \\
            There is black written on white \\
            There I there is sephia tones, and blue hormones \\
            Where the future calls so bright \\
            There nothing to do \\
            Nothing I’d rather see \\
            Than the light of the one \\

            In a footnote of a different time \\
            I see with the leaves retracting \\
            And the windows’ growing rime \\
            A cold sensation sweeps me away \\
            As I’m dragged into what I once knew \\
            Destined to rewrite what I saw \\
            And describe as ”one of the few” \\
            As the dead creep, dancing \\
            And I’m thrown off once more \\
            I see my time, as I once did \\
            In the greatness and galore \\
            In a three by three time \\
            And fashionably clothed \\
            I see, in them, what I now love \\
            That I all before loathed \\
            I teach myself of patience \\
            But I don’t see eye to eye \\
            I want to pray for purification \\
            But I don’t want to say goodbye \\
            The dancing dead, float above my head \\
            And laugh me to my grave \\
            I want to greet whatever comes \\
            But I’m afaid I’m not that brave \\

            Breach their walls and tell the tale \\
            Of the Oxanans greatest gift \\
            Have them regress, and reassess \\
            And make their future swift \\
            In a world threatened by time \\
            Where peace is the destination \\

            Seipiad by the gray \\
            Created by eternity \\
            In the glass house of time \\
            I toss a coin up in the air \\
            Wasting my last dime \\
            A woman blessed with a curse \\
            And a desperation trapped within \\
            Rotting from the inside \\
            She can’t help but grin I see in the light of her \\
            A past by Yar’s mistake \\
            Past the trees of Odenna \\
            And further past the lake \\

            What is there to see? \\
            When every path you’ll ever take \\

            Alive in your winged form \\
            And spreading like winds \\

            In my travels as of late \\
            I feel a certain ambition \\
            Breaking new ground and worries \\
            But keeping true to tradition \\
            My hunger grows deep \\
            And my senses grow true \\
            I feel a certain way \\
            And I feel it with you \\
            I can grasp my future with my fist \\
            And I can carry my own weight \\
            But I need someone to narrow me \\
            And keep my path straight \\
            Because I feel distant past \\
            I can sense the futures grip \\
            I brave my thoughts and go \\
            Toes dipping with just the tip \\
            Swallowing me whole \\
            As the water surrounds me \\
            I long to be loved \\
            As much as I long to be free \\
            My dreams teach me \\
            Of what I should do \\
            And right now it’s telling me \\
            To stay right with you \\

            I can sense her movement \\
            Within the boundaries of my room \\
            I kan sense her eyes wandering \\
            Throughout my ever gloom \\
            Mirrored in your iris \\
            I can see the shining light \\
            Letting out a tiny breath \\
            Wallowing within your delight \\
            Spelling the letters out loud \\
            With your Kaleidoscope eyes \\
            Finding my infamy shrouded \\
            And my face beneath the disguise \\
            You may not recover me fully \\
            You may never make me whole \\
            But you breath new found life \\
            Into a withered old soul \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{The Spire of Stars - XXXIX}
        \begin{verse}
            I dream of distant planets \\
            I am just a little boy. \\
            Someone will share my wonder \\
            As I shed a tear of joy \\
            I left without reason \\
            Without cause and rest \\
            I thought it would lead to something \\
            And it was ultimately the best \\
            The pop in my mind \\
            And the fuel to drive me there \\
            A distant light, I sensed it, \\
            Driven by my personal fear \\
            I clenched my fist in anger \\
            As I lived through my pain \\
            I closed my eyes and realised \\
            That nothing could remain \\
            I cut my ties and left alone \\
            In a future held by me \\
            Somewhere that I could finally \\
            Live the life of the free \\
            And now right next to planets \\
            I dream of distant space \\
            I awake in tears, my worst fears \\
            I could not fill it’s place \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Wilt - XL}
        \begin{verse}
            As the story unfolds \\
            Just like in that day \\
            I stay vigilant, the same \\
            Passive and away \\
            I tie my sorrows to the sky \\
            I look for onward light \\
            I find something new to grasp \\
            To my very own delight \\
            As the story unfolds \\
            I sleep with my own guilt \\
            A never ending story \\
            A blue flower left to wilt \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Starlight - XLI}
        \begin{verse}
            Try not to speak \\
            Ill fated words, my grace \\
            Not of her posture, her clothes \\
            Her body nor her face \\
            You will find a fondness \\
            And a very useful reciprocation \\
            You will find it living, breathing \\
            Within your destination \\
            Try not to stare \\
            At those stars, my grace \\
            You’ll be disgraced by family \\
            And banished from this place \\            
        \end{verse}
        
        \poemtitle{Spite of Steena - XLI}
        \begin{verse}
            Four eyes stare me down \\
            This unaventful night \\
            I look for answers and for help \\
            A harbinger of spite \\
            I do my wishful thinking \\
            And I read the texts of old \\
            I tell people what the want to hear \\
            Hoping my heart can be sold \\
            I swing back and forth \\
            The stars vanish and appear \\
            In one moment utter delight \\
            In another, crippling fear \\
            I want to be freed \\
            I’ve saud so for so long \\
            I require the faithul blue \\
            I need to sing that song \\
            So please, stars of wonder \\
            I beg for your inward light \\
            I seek your newfound answers \\
            A harbinger of spite \\

        \poemtitle{Deserted Emotions - XLIII}
        \begin{verse}
            Just now we march together \\
            Your hand within my arm \\
            Betraying old words \\
            But meaning no harm \\
            Dressed to impress \\
            And heart in hand \\
            I take us to the beach \\
            And walk across the sand \\
            My eyes follow through \\
            But my words betray me first \\
            I try to explain, my inner pain \\
            My unquenchable thirst \\
            We cannot see eye to eye \\
            We cannot see at all \\
            While face to face, we will embrace \\
            All we have is a call \\
            The beach turns into dessert \\
            My soul trapped within \\
            I see the heavenly light \\
            Brush against my skin \\
            Tulips and some roses \\
            Plant them here and there \\
            I hope that I can save it all \\
            With four eyes bound to stare \\

        \begin{verse}
            The future holds us tight \\
            Releasing by the though \\
            I knew what you were seeking \\
            Because I received what I sought \\
            But this happiness was shortsighted \\
            The root of evil astound \\
            I reach, jump and try again \\
            But fall flat, on the ground \\
            I burn the tinder carefully \\
            As I rest for the night \\
            I that the morning awaits \\
            And in it comes the fight \\
            I know that the ashes will be the end \\
            I know that I follow \\
            My feels sadness already \\
            As it all withers, and turns hollow \\
            This is sadness, this is prophecy \\
            This is happiness, this is heresy \\
            Through the anger, comes the unwise \\
            From the ashes starts his demise \\

        \begin{verse}
            I can sense danger \\
            From the inward lamp \\
            In a cellar so cold \\
            Yet a bedroom so damp \\
            I sense the air escaping \\
            As it all fills with the lake \\
            I sense the truest true \\
            As I open my eyes to the fake \\
            I judge you as equal \\
            As you would judge me \\
            As I go from being loved \\
            To rightfully, being free \\
            I relive your words \\
            Every night in my sleep \\
            I thank you for your kindness \\
            Harrowed in the deep \\
            I relive old songs \\
            As four eyes turn to two \\
            I look towards the inward lamp \\
            Hoping it would pull through \\

            Anytime I think the thought \\
            I know what waits for me \\
            A distant time and place \\
            A friend awaiting in flee \\
            I’ve tried to bounce back \\
            And I’ve tried to move ahead \\
            But I still wake every day \\
            Tired, in the same old bed \\

        \begin{verse}
            I can see your last request \\
            I chose this regret \\
            Like air, I walk alone \\
            My thoughts turn my heart to stone \\
            I dream as I would awake \\
            A song, my own mistake \\
            I die, as I would have lived \\
            But take not as I would have gived \\

        \begin{verse}
            An old alias awaits \\
            The knight of the wind \\
            A life lost to smiles \\
            Turned evil grin \\
            The mark on an era \\
            A mania returns \\
            Feeding your ego \\
            As your life lives and learns \\
            The king of the clouds \\
            Henceforth embarks \\
            Leaving trails of nothingness \\
            And checking it’s marks \\
            As my life bleaks to white \\
            A dark mist enshrouds \\
            I live in this darkness \\
            The King of the Clouds \\

            I foresee a future \\
            One with blue, regret and despair \\
            I have seen the present and the future \\
            With determination and without care \\
            I’m just a charlatan \\
            Writing music for guitar \\
            Flashing my emotions \\
            My tattoo, and my scar \\

        \poemtitle{The Mountaintop - L}
        \begin{verse}
            I have spent years climbing \\
            The love of our mountaintop \\
            You’re leaning over the edge \\
            But I cannot make you stop \\
            It was faster, more agile \\
            Than attempting the impossible \\
            You were sly and adventurous \\
            I was sad and methodical \\
            You reached as I climbed \\
            Unjust, rest your head \\
            I climbed for us both \\
            Wishing I was alone instead \\
            You just didn’t love me \\
            You were passing the time \\
            From the peak of the mountain \\
            I can see you climb \\
            For future reference \\
            I’ll stay behind \\
            My love made you passionless \\
            And yours made me blind \\            
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{Winter Queen - I}
        \begin{verse}
            As a cold sensation, begs for my attention \\
            I seek to understand the lie \\
            I try to find, but cannot climb \\
            And learn from when I cry \\
            The bonds that hold it together \\
            Keep my hands at bay \\
            I said what you wanted to hear \\
            But you didn’t hear what I wanted to say \\
            The future, I cannot see \\
            Memoria; A star aligns \\
            I keep my peace, but wonder \\
            As the snow reflection blinds \\
            Both my heart and my mind \\
            I’m yours, as the moon and the night \\
            Bind me up, cast me away \\
            The wind beneath my kite \\
            I lay in peace, years away \\
            As my mind drifts to wonder \\
            I think, relax and process \\
            I feel, I try, I ponder \\
            Oh, dear Memoria, my sweet winder queen \\
            The cold wind blows my way \\
            I finish the through, and leave distraught \\
            Her love leads me astray \\            
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{Antumbra - II}
        \begin{verse}
            The light shines from the moon \\
            As the night fades away \\
            It brings me no peace \\
            As the light welcomes day \\
            Inherently unwanted, \\
            Unnecessary and lost \\
            I feed my addiction \\
            Feeding on the frost \\
            As my heart shivers \\
            As my mouth goes hush \\
            A future, so barren \\
            And a past, so lush \\
            The light of the moon \\
            It all turns to dark \\
            As there are no staring eyes \\
            No brand new spark \\
            A nightmare, a past \\
            No objective reality \\
            No future, no hope \\
            A terrible duality \\
            The antumbral essence \\
            Creeps from all around \\
            My east can but hear \\
            That unhelpful, guttural sound \\

        \begin{verse}
            I miss the days when I would stay \\
            And you would tell me stories \\
            There were no tasks, there was no school \\
            No job, no stress, no worries \\

        \poemtitle{Asleep - IV}
        \begin{verse}
            As I have seen colours \\
            I have also seen dark \\
            The white texts radiate \\
            The emotions of my heart \\
            I think very clearly \\
            But I don't react accordingly \\
            I smile and nod dorkly, \\
            While you feel me up, adorably \\
            I laugh in the awkwardness \\
            As you tell me to be quiet \\
            You tell me I'm beautiful \\
            But I don't buy it \\
            I rip and tear in the dream \\
            I react as I would awake \\
            I thought it was reality \\
            The everlasting, tortured, mistake \\
            The past is not the present \\
            Winx, when will you learn \\
            You haven't seen enough wrong \\
            To know what you should earn \\
            If love is not enough \\
            Put my enemies to sleep \\
            I reach for the lantern \\
            As I fall back into the deep \\

        \poemtitle{The Piano Knows - V}
        \begin{verse}
            The sound of silence \\
            Rings through \\
            As I reach for the book \\
            Next page, something new \\
            A sheet of notes \\
            A brand new song \\
            Galvanising poems \\
            Reaching ever long \\
            The lies I've heard \\
            And the truths I've hid \\
            The box of deceptions \\
            Closed with a lid \\
            The sound of music \\
            Reaches through the room \\
            As I reach for a piano \\
            Uncertain doom \\
            You heard my prayers \\
            You heard my voice \\
            You gave me no reason \\
            You gave me no choice \\
            You filled my head, \\
            All the way through \\
            Now the piano knows \\
            The things I never told you \\

        \poemtitle{The Downwell - VI}
        \begin{verse}
            The future leads \\
            My thoughtful insight \\
            I deem it fruitful \\
            And the lantern bright \\
            I feel it flying \\
            A thousand colours ahead \\
            I seem them in my life \\
            But never from my bed \\
            Valiant effort \\
            Yes, nothing, is above it all \\
            It leads me astray, \\
            But away from the fall \\
            The downwell is dangerous \\
            And I see no reason there \\
            I peak my head down \\
            But it never seems any clear \\
            I look apon the fields \\
            Where I found reason \\
            I see the end, not the beginning \\
            Not love, but treason \\
            I feel alone, yet again \\
            Nothing fills this void \\
            A loveless past and pressent \\
            Means my future is destroyed \\

        \poemtitle{Festival of the Lost - VII}
        \begin{verse}
            Everything changes \\
            While I stay behind \\
            The future declines me \\
            As I embrace time \\
            I see within the eye \\
            The storm brewing anew \\
            Too many people to feel \\
            As those i meet, are too few \\
            I grasp on to precious feelings \\
            A blue flower in my dreams \\
            I cry to the songs of the lost \\
            As no new future shows its seams \\
            Left behind by Laex \\
            Odenna and the blue \\
            I seek to understand \\
            Why there are so many of you? \\
            Lost within my heart \\
            Do not dare to speak of blame \\
            I lost it all when I lost them \\
            My future, my life, my name \\

        \poemtitle{Pleasureless - VIII}
        \begin{verse}
            A baren future, no hand \\
            A king befallen regicide \\
            This romantic hoplessness \\
            Has no pleasure and no pride \\
            A castle build with effort \\
            And I live within it \\
            A butter building \\
            Melting by the minute \\
        \end{verse}

                
        \poemtitle{Sanctuary - IX}
        \begin{verse}
            To all the emotions \\
            And all the flirt \\
            To all the people \\
            That I have hurt \\
            A sanctuary for our visions \\
            And a place for rest \\
            As we push our loved ones \\
            And wish for their best \\
            To the conversations \\
            The memories and the past \\
            You know your first, \\
            Nobody knows the last \\
            Our future holds no candle \\
            To the flame that once stood lit \\
            To the ones that lost meaning \\
            Or the ones that quit \\
            The friends, the lovers \\
            The despair and heartbreak \\
            Living in infamy \\
            Between the heartless and the fake \\
            To the future \\
            May it be written well \\
            To the friends I lost \\
            May they all be swell \\
            To all the friends \\
            We made along the way \\
            Join me in the sanctuary \\
            Where all the memories stay \\

        \poemtitle{Eyes of Tomorrow - X}
        \begin{verse}
            The splicers hide their minds \\
            As they seek one all anew \\
            A science, damned, forbidden \\
            Relished by few \\
            A red cloak flags in the wind \\
            As the winter bites your cowl \\
            You rev your machines engines \\
            As the cold wind howls \\
            Wielding darkness, Wielding light \\
            The enemy swaps places \\
            We seek new answers \\
            The conflict, lied on stasis \\
            We seek to destroy \\
            Salvations wretched plan \\
            They latch on to the walls \\
            The eliksnis last stand \\
            They seek the technology \\
            On which Humanity would borrow \\
            Blinded, scourged by the past \\
            They seek eyes of Tomorrow \\

        \poemtitle{Powerless Misstakes - XI}
        \begin{verse}
            As words are written powerless \\
            The future ascends the throne \\
            I blink into the arms of people \\
            I open to being alone \\
            In times of trubble I sing the song \\
            The people follow through \\
            I drink the wine, I bide my time \\
            I find another "you" \\
            In past events I forget, I think \\
            I dine another place \\
            A king of the clouds, a Knight of the wind \\
            A no-one fell from grace \\
            Not once, not twice, through life he lies \\
            And I blink once again \\
            A lover lost, no colours, no cost \\
            A nobody once a friend \\
        \end{verse}

                
        \poemtitle{The End: Part VI (The Wicked) - XII}
        \begin{verse}
            A while ago, I promised \\
            That one day I'd die alone \\
            A mindless creatue followed \\
            As my soul returned home \\
            I looked back upon \\
            The treads in the light \\
            I thought about my faliures \\
            And the things that I did right \\
            Sing for me, violinist \\
            And Laex will light aflame \\
            Her vicious magic fules me \\
            While the future lays tame \\
            Once again I'm torn apart \\
            New location, same pain \\
            Repeated cycle, new poem \\
            Infinite last refrain \\
            A pool of blighted people \\
            Could not find my peace \\
            As I crossed endless mountains \\
            Just to feel release \\
            Years have passed since amaranth \\
            And less so since the blue \\
            They feel like sorrow yesterday \\
            When my thoughts befall onto you \\
            The emotions stand arisen \\
            They stood the test of time \\
            They echo all through \\
            My endless, pityed rhymes \\
            Yesterday's ending \\
            Proves the note's prosperity \\
            I lose the chance for you \\
            While retaking the memory \\
            I flaunt my efforts \\
            In the new light of mine \\
            I push ahead into the horizon \\
            As the past seems sublime \\
            I pray for the wicked \\
            As I lay my hands together \\
            I seek the ending to my missery \\
            But I doubt it would be any better \\
            Laex returns to heart \\
            Her magic as cruel as ever \\
            Reviving one final ending \\
            As the ending goes on forever \\
        \end{verse}

                
        \poemtitle{The Queen of the Hive - XIII}
        \begin{verse}
            I seek further judgment \\
            That day lingers instead \\
            My back against the wall \\
            The pillow, quiet in my bed \\
            The scent of inquisition \\
            And the ever longing stow \\
            To once loved, once lost \\
            A toast to letting go \\
            A toast, but no partner \\
            A tear falls upon her cheek \\
            It's been a month, a year \\
            But somehow feels like a week \\
            Nowhere to inquire \\
            A communication for the dead \\
            Our lives live seperate \\
            As we both live in dread \\
            A dead queen bee \\
            Disrupts a million hives \\
            Forever in my head, be the last \\
            Until a new one arrives \\
        \end{verse}

                
        \poemtitle{The Factory - XIV}
        \begin{verse}
            In the time before the madness \\
            I would rest in lands of stone \\
            I'd treat my travels dearly. \\
            While soulless bound, alone \\
            We saw beauty in the garden. \\
            We saw salvation, and its curse. \\
            Only a life as good as can be \\
            Ever becomes worse \\
            In the drawings, we saw life \\
            And found it all the same \\
            I saw truth and lies \\
            But no one took the blame \\
            It fabricated results \\
            Told a tale of somewhat truths \\
            Paintings etch the words alone \\
            Two lovers, passionate youths \\
            But passion turns to anguish \\
            And anguish into dread \\
            Sow the perfect solution \\
            Turn the needle on its head \\
            The walls engraved in words \\
            That stand of unriddled paint \\
            One can find no solution \\
            But answers, written faint \\
            To the eye of the beholder \\
            Solves the lovers crest \\
            The sleepless makes a funny noise \\
            As the sleepless fall to rest \\
        \end{verse}

                
        \poemtitle{Gospel - XV}
        \begin{verse}
            Greif strikes the city \\
            In which we guide to meet \\
            I find my mind, mesmerised \\
            As gospel paves the steet \\
            In reference I see diamonds \\
            And in destruction, those that remain \\
            She sees stars through my passion \\
            And in my words, pain \\
            The plate controls my actions \\
            It leads me astray \\
            I want to keep them closer \\
            But prospects fade away \\
            I could be invincible \\
            For all I hope and care \\
            Nothing will bring me closer \\
            To the last day you were here \\
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{Sorrows Harbour - XVI}
        \begin{verse}
            Bodies line my thoughts \\
            Meaningless, they float adrift \\
            Winters sorrow bursts my bubble \\
            As their heart causes lift \\
            A pain I've grown a fondness \\
            As dubious as it may sound
            Bark gently at the kitten \\
            As quickly painted a hound \\
            Formerly frost would chill me \\
            As a scarf enamores my soul \\
            A mischievous action calls \\
            As my sorrow grows whole \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{Corridors of Time - XVII}
        \begin{verse}
            In a new wave of passion \\
            I wake from this dream \\
            New eyes, I found them \\
            As I explain what I've seen \\
            A king of the clouds \\
            In Yar's paradise \\
            I hide my true intentions \\
            Under mask and disguise \\
            I see reflections, like water \\
            It waves and goes away \\
            As soon as it appears it's gone \\
            Praying it would stay \\
            I feel the emotion left behind \\
            Prancing like old words, a rhyme \\
            Fluttering in my heart \\
            In the corridors of time \\
            The halls lie empty \\
            At least from what I see \\
            I hear chatter and laughter \\
            Gathinging around me \\
            Crescendoing trancendance \\
            As two eyes turn to eight \\
            Seal me in my own dispair \\
            And tell me of my fate \\
            No energy for a future \\
            Too much, spent on the past \\
            I slow down my mind \\
            As the world goes too fast \\
            I cannot catch up \\
            Cannot catch my breath \\
            The corridors of time beckons \\
            As my eyes meet with death \\
            And eight turns to two \\
            As two turn to none \\
            Ending where we started \\
            As we started to become \\
            My hope is my riches \\
            And I'm only worth a dime \\
            As I flee into solitude \\
            In the corridors of time \\
        \end{verse}

        \begin{verse}
            The window is stuck \\
            As I move to release \\
            The -pane underneath is reckless \\
            And the -sill, begging please \\
            I want to see a future \\
            But your fission breeds doubt \\
            Turning laughter into whispers \\
            And as you whisper, I shout \\
            From a rosebed of emotion \\
            My mind rots to slumber \\
            A terrain, I know dearly \\
            Left terribly and encumbered \\
            A new verse to the song \\
            But the melody is sharp \\
            A bit overtuned, speeding \\
            Glaringly untuned harp \\
            I don't understand \\
            And I don't know if I ever will \\
            A third degree of sunlight \\
            Out cold on the windowsill \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{Sins of the Past - XIX}
        \begin{verse}
            Fickle words thrown around \\
            Meant only as a tease \\
            At first they're gentle \\
            Architected to please \\
            But words turn harrow \\
            With times, a vitriolic pace \\
            There is no duty worse than words \\
            And no royalty without grace \\
            With my crown of sorrow \\
            Let me forever reign \\
            Based not on the sins of my past \\
            Nor as the monster I became \\
            Let the words drip forver \\
            Reminding me of defeat \\
            As we trod a forward path \\
            To the place, the beginning street \\
            Words jump, up and down \\
            I ask myself forever \\
            Is there a heart inside the night? \\
            And is her worth, endured, endeavor? \\
            Judge me not my failures \\
            On the coups I did not combat \\
            On the expeditions into wilderness \\
            Up the mountains, terrain flat \\
            Her words echo into eons \\
            And bounce around the stars \\
            Her music sparks old passions \\
            Her words open old scars \\

        \begin{verse}
            I open my phone \\
            To stare at the bright lights \\
            I do this every morning \\
            I do this every night \\
            My fingers are tired \\
            And my soul even more \\
            A magnitude of nothingness \\
            As sleeping becomes a chore \\
            However, it feels easier \\
            Than leaving this state \\
            I blankly stare for hours \\
            Accepting my fate \\
            Oh no, there she is \\
            Her face upon my screen \\
            An inevitable nightmare \\
            Of the social media machine \\
            Now every picture \\
            Her eyes, her lips \\
            No barrier of entry \\
            A message on my fingertips \\
            One click and it's gone \\
            My mind retreats once more \\
            An abundance of omnipresence \\
            As awakening becomes a chore \\
            I open my phone \\
            To touch at the bright lights \\
            I do this every morning \\
            I do this every night \\

        \poemtitle{Memorabilia - XXI}
        \begin{verse}
            As I look back upon my journey \\
            From Inahavens molten core \\
            I see a man I used to be \\
            But don't recognize anymore \\
            A confident, but cocky \\
            Unclaimed young man \\
            Unwilling to learn, and to listen \\
            To focus and understand \\
            As we walked through the plains of Lypso \\
            As we wandered in our own soul \\
            We learned of our place \\
            And we manifested our goal \\
            Through the lake of Violina \\
            To the Lost gardens of Yar \\
            It never feels like a journey alone \\
            But together we got far \\
            A story spans forever \\
            Through generations of text \\
            We can always look upon our past \\
            But never know what's next \\
            Memorabilia, nostalgia \\
            And a dash of contempt \\
            We can all look towards the future \\
            But the past makes us exempt \\
            From embracing our lovely selves \\
            And our far flung truths \\
            We bathe in our sexuality \\
            And identify as youths \\
            Kiss me, sweet nothingness \\
            And let me walk alone \\
            No matter how long I walk \\
            I will never get home \\

        \poemtitle{My Fears - I}
        \begin{verse}
            It has come to my attantion \\
            That we are bound to these dreams \\
            A love that spans centuries \\
            A hope, as bright as it's beams \\
            I wilfully change my passion \\
            As it suits our pursuit \\
            Grant me passage, sweet princess \\
            Let me not allow to pillage for loot \\
            I am but blind in your eyes \\
            As I see no future there \\
            I write you messages now, Peresteena \\
            Not out of love, out of fear \\
            For while the present demands me \\
            And my past recognizes none \\
            I am tied to the feeling \\
            Of becoming someone \\
            That might die to this feeling \\
            As it is worth dying to \\
            My letters grant passage \\
            And my anxiety follows through \\

        \poemtitle{My Flaws - II}
        \begin{verse}
            I write to you this day \\
            With echoes of remorse \\
            Letters riddled with lies \\
            Messages causing discourse \\
            Rarely reminded of this truth \\
            I pick my narrative \\
            I chose to see what I want \\
            Remember what I believe \\
            It helps my understanding \\
            But it drags my cause \\
            For how good are your strengths \\
            Without recognizing your flaws? \\
            Laex had no flaws \\
            In my narrative mind \\
            She was passionate, loving \\
            Elegant and kind \\
            Why would I want this? \\
            In the future I forsee \\
            Let's seek some other comfort \\
            And let's see how that can be \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Actions - III}
        \begin{verse}
            I looked her in the eyes \\
            As I saw what she said \\
            A visual queue trapped \\
            Deep within my head \\
            It drew something out of me \\
            An impulse, nothing more \\
            But the past holds no candle \\
            To the actions made before \\
            I make my bed and sleep \\
            As I fall into dreams \\
            Life might seem precious \\
            But it is not all what it seems \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Mistakes - IV}
        \begin{verse}
            I am haunted by facts \\
            I am riddled with my sins \\
            I don't know where my suffer ends \\
            And where my healing begins \\
            My words spark feelings \\
            And those feelings spark words \\
            And instead of getting what I wanted \\
            I'm hearing things I never heard \\
            They design me, and refrain me \\
            From within this room, this hole \\
            My last sung virtues \\
            Crawling out of my soul \\
            I trust myself in the mornings \\
            I trust myself when we'd sleep \\
            Waking to your voice \\
            Dreaming further deep \\
            I could feel you months later \\
            When my passion fell ill \\
            When you confronted my mistakes \\
            And perjured my will \\
            I sleep now in silence \\
            As I once did then \\
            Now with no new partner \\
            And no new friend \\
            Peresteena rules this day \\
            But Mayasteena stays behind \\
            Hiding in plain sight \\
            As I seek the one I cannot find \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Finality - V}
        \begin{verse}
            As the day falls to rest \\
            I recount my final days \\
            We always pray for greetings \\
            Pray this time for parted ways \\
            A new chapter, a new view \\
            The same me, the same you \\
            I look upon my penumbra \\
            With thoughts of pride \\
            When I know in that time \\
            I had no-one to confide \\
            Why am I bound \\
            To the day that lies behind \\
            When I know well and perfect \\
            There are always new things to find? \\
            Two eras away now \\
            I yearn to find a break \\
            To the disruptive actions \\
            Finding reality within the fake \\
            In my finality I see light \\
            Because fickle words always do \\
            Then pray tell, why my cold heart \\
            Still wonders about you? \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Individuality - VI}
        \begin{verse}
            If this week of change \\
            As tought me one thing \\
            It's to emrbace the hurtful \\
            A sweet sorrows sting \\
            I could climb for ages \\
            With no goal in mind \\
            I could live in darkness \\
            Not knowing what I'd find \\
            But a part of me lusts \\
            For the thing life will not grant \\
            My hands, resolving embrace \\
            And my body knows it can't \\
            So, although not whole, \\
            Is that not enough? \\
            Do I need all of me \\
            To beat through the rough? \\
            Maybe I gave her too much \\
            And now I am without \\
            No soul to luster \\
            Nobody to doubt \\
            There is nothing left of me \\
            When the dust settles in stone \\
            Read the writing on the wall, Laex \\
            Without you I'm alone \\
        \end{verse}

        \poemtitle{My Secrets - VIII}
        \begin{verse}
            A day at a time \\
            I wrongfully accuse \\
            My blatant act of kindness \\
            My wilful excuse \\
            Found words hidden from me \\
            A different time by far \\
            Err, I declared, alone \\
            May question who you are \\
            Hid from everyone \\
            Myself included obviously \\
            My secrets plague my inner \\
            Dementing you and me \\
            Forgotten, farewell \\
            My sweet new ghost \\
            Letters to Peresteena \\
            But no-one to carry my post \\
            In the distance, a garden \\
            With flowers and with fruit \\
            My blissful darling resides there \\
            Elegantly playing the flute \\
            But all music goes sharp \\
            As the tune switches tone \\
            I’d rather cry in comfort \\
            Than laugh all  alone \\
            And for you  my dear love \\
            May hope lie close \\
            I fear sadness for the woman \\
            In the garden of the rose \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Intentions - IX}
        \begin{verse}
            As I stand, as I say \\
            I could walk a thousand miles \\
            I could write pretty letters \\
            I could send my goodbyes \\
            There are many a thing \\
            For some reason I do intend \\
            Playing cards with my emotions \\
            Hiding, playing pretend \\
            Many a name would they call me \\
            As intentions changed so did they \\
            I could do nothing more than few \\
            Bend my knees, fold and pray \\
            Her vision flashes before me \\
            And I intend to pursue \\
            Find out if I still want it \\
            And hoping you do too \\
        \end{verse}

        
        \poemtitle{My Connections - X}
        \begin{verse}
            We form our duly manners \\
            In an orthodox way \\
            We carry issues with us  \\
            As actors conducting play \\
            We fill the shoes of those before \\
            But our feet are far  too small \\
            We build our terrace with no railing \\
            Hoping we don't fall \\
            But when we do, we suffer \\
            With no medication to aid \\
            I'd tell you I'm ready for it \\
            But frankly I'm afraid \\
            "And rightfully so" I say \\
            In the echo chamber of my mind \\
            Failing to see right before me \\
            As my connections fall behind \\
            So I need bridges to you \\
            But it cannot be me \\
            If I build these bridges \\
            I would never be free \\
            As they'd connect us together \\
            But the cobblestone would be mine \\
            And we all know the future \\
            Where I'm broken and you're fine \\
            Our bridges are always built \\
            To cover narrow gaps \\
            I watch them very eagerly \\
            As I feel time elapse \\
        \end{verse}
