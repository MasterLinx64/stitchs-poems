        \poemtitle{The Flower of Life - I}
        \begin{verse}
        Some flowers are small \\
        Some bloom more \\
        When I look up to the sky \\
        I can see the stars sore \\
        When the flowers make love float in the air \\
        That's when, there is nothing to fear \\
        When the lightning cracks and heaven opens it's door \\
        That's when I relized \\
        Love is something more \\
        \end{verse}

            When the window breaks \\
            I know the time has come \\
            For you there might be many \\
            But for us there are just some \\
            So don't tell me \\
            What I can't or can \\
            You think you are better 
            Just because of your love span \\
            Girl, you might think i'm an ugly guy \\
            But with stars as standards, no wonder why \\
            Just take a moment, relax and swell \\
            Please! For all sakes, do tell! \\
            I promise not to sett my anger free \\

            \begin{verse}
            If you follow the beat \\
            you might get your way \\
            If you follow your instincts \\
            you might fly away \\
            If you follow love \\
            the best things will come true \\
            If you follow the stream \\
            You might find something new \\
            But if you follow yourself \\
            You can't go wrong \\
            'cause if you forfill your dream \\
            Love is always strong \\

            \begin{verse}
                Once apon a time, there was a man who was confused \\
                He tried to impress a lady  \\
                She was not amused \\
                The poor man was in distress \\
                The poor man loved the mistress \\
                So one day, he searched for assistance \\
                He met a women of the resistance \\
                She knew how to please a lady \\
                The plan was weird \\
                And the plan was shady \\
                He knew now what he had to do \\
                So he reached the castle \\
                And he made it true \\
                He walked up to the girl \\
                He had remembered all the tips \\
                And from that moment \\
                He kissed her lips \\

        \poemtitle{Hero - V}
            \begin{verse}
                The times you wish you were the hero \\
                The times you wish you were the star \\
                The times you tried to do things right \\
                But never got any far \\
                Don't we all wish for a better future \\
                Don't we all erease the past \\
                The things that are done \\
                Are the things though of last \\
                I want to be the hero \\
                To be the one who can change \\
                To be the one with power \\
                To do the rearrange \\
                But end up being the villain \\
                For all the crimes I do \\
                I am left alone \\
                But she is too \\
                My fair maiden \\
                The one far away \\
                The one I want back \\
                The one I wan't to stay \\
                No, we cant all be the heroes \\
                Some of us must fall \\
                The greater they are \\
                The greater the call \\

                So I don't know if it's bright \\
                It would be nice with a hint or two \\
                If that's what I get \\
                Then thats what il do \\
                It seems like everybody has seen the light \\
                And that I'm left behind \\
                Like I'm all alone \\
                Like I'm one of a kind \\

        \begin{verse}
            The people I loved are here today \\
            Never for me \\
            They would never stay \\
            The people I loved \\
            Never loved me back \\
            I didn't deserve it \\
            Cause of my lack \\
            For understanding their way \\
            For the things I did \\
            For future day \\
            The only person I can say ever loved me back \\
            Has a boy friend, not to ever have me \\
            Thats why i can say \\
            It could never be \\
            I have only been rejected \\
            It's really sad because \\
            I never reflected \\
            Upon the things that was important \\
            Upon the things that were true \\
            I'd never lie \\
            I adore you \\
            You know who I'm talking about \\
            The one and only one that's to shout \\
            She has a boyfriend too \\
            Not to shabby \\
            I think he'll do \\
            But then again \\
            Who am I to charge? \\
            I can't even get a girlfriend \\
            How's that for large? \\
            I wish some day  \\
            I'll find the one \\
            To hold my son \\
            The one she \\
            That's perfect for me \\

        \begin{verse}
            I'm sorry \\
            But i have to go \\
            I'm sorry for the things i did \\
            I'm sorry for the things that show \\
            I have to carry my own way \\
            You would make it worse if I'd stay \\
            So please, please leave me alone \\
            You brought me pain \\
            Of all the things you've done \\
            You've left me in vain \\
            I thought it would be just fine \\
            I thought I would survive \\
            I thought that you were mine \\
            But that thought left long ago \\
            Along with the believes \\
            For things that were so \\
            The things that were so good \\
            You gave me up \\
            Like you never should! \\
            Never trust me \\
            Never again \\
            Cause I'm sick of you trying to be my friend \\
            When all you do is take me down \\
            And when I fall I always drown \\
            But you have been there in between \\
            The times I didn't make it for the scene \\
            I'm sorry if you get offended \\
            But that's pretty much how this ended \\
            Listen, yes we can be friends \\
            But I can't control my self anymore \\
            So please leave me alone \\
            I't only makes me sore \\
            My love for you has always been the same \\
            But some how and some where \\
            This turned into a game \\
            But I don't want to play \\
            I don't even want to stay \\
            Please forgive me for the damage I've done \\
            I hope you have forgot me by the rise of the sun \\

    \poemtitle{Why so awkward? - X}
        \begin{verse}
            As i sit here wondering what I did \\
            The things I said \\
            The things I hid \\
            Some times I become weird \\
            I get awkward and stupid \\
            I get strange with those who cared \\
            But there is no shame \\
            Everybody can be here \\
            To blame \\
            And see that nervous is what it was \\
            And I hope you see why and because \\
            An easy explanation really \\
            Quite short quite freely \\
            It is because of love \\
            The thing that makes the birds fly above \\
            And on top of that \\
            It's normal \\
            It's good and nice \\
            It's formal \\
            Don't believe me? \\
            Look back \\
            See the time go into attack \\
            Yes there you see \\
            It's nothing to fear \\
            Nothing to be afraid of \\
            No need to stare \\

    \poemtitle{The Truth - XI}
        \begin{verse}
            For all I know the truths betrayed \\
            For all I said \\
            Has now been laid \\
            To rest somewhere \\
            Lost in time \\
            Lost is space \\
            But makes us rime \\
            And trust in the things we think are true \\
            And to fall down on what that pull us through \\
            But the truth is a happy thing \\
            For that it makes us joy and sing \\
            For all happiness for all of us \\
            And there you have it \\
            The truth is a plus \\

    \poemtitle{Hopes - XII}
        \begin{verse}
            As times change \\
            We look at the past \\
            Look at the things that didn't last \\
            Some didn't get the time to start \\
            Others made it far \\
            And wished upon a star \\
            But I, \\
            I stayed the same \\
            I didn't change \\
            Not Even for fame \\
            So now, I am as strong as ever \\
            Like Justin Bieber \\
            Never say never \\
            So do what I say \\
            And never give up your dreams \\
            That way you can invent schemes \\
            The schemes of today and tomorrow \\
            The ones that future people may borrow \\
            So use you brain and practise hard \\
            That way we can all share the shard \\

            What did I change? \\
            Something strange happend \\

            Like my whole life is now rearranged! \\
            I know it's just me \\
            But I really hope you can see \\
            That I really want things to go back \\
            It's really like i'm going to attack \\
            Someone for something they did \\
            Now open the jar \\
            And lift the lid \\
            I don't know what to say \\
            I don't know what to do \\
            Please help me decide \\
            What, where and who? \\
            What did they do? \\
            I can't remember! \\
            Now help me too! \\
            I want to know! \\
            I want the truth \\
            But I guess I will never find a booth \\
            A booth that could spawn my past \\
            And tell me \\
            Did it ever last? \\

            A new way \\
            A way to start over what has been \\
            A time for all that ended \\
            To have a time to begin \\
            A way to restart \\
            A time to do what is wanted \\
            A time to do our part \\
            As time restarts \\
            The things are the same \\
            It will be like this \\
            Every day \\

            My whole life seems so new \\
            I don't know what to do \\
            I seem to break all I've got \\
            I screw up every single shot \\
            All I do is so undone \\
            I can't seem to find the fun \\
            I don't even care any more \\
            So please help me aid whats sore \\
            My life is just so full of stress \\
            And even my friends could't care less \\
            I really don't care for love \\
            Because I never trust those things above \\
            Above my perfect point of view \\
            But that is where I see you \\
            Lurking from behind my back \\
            Trying to go for attack \\
            But you have somebody by your side \\
            And I don't know where to hide \\
            My feelings are just so blind \\
            I don't even know who to find \\
            I just know my luck has changed \\
            And all that was, is rearranged \\
            Don't think that i am the same \\
            Cause then you only have yourself to blame \\
            I've changed allot through this time \\
            I can't even follow the chime \\
            But I guess my life is better like this \\
            But maybe that is what i'l miss \\

            It cannot be undone \\
            It tells me who I am \\
            Without it, I am just a scam \\
            I will follow the path it makes \\
            So that I can use all that it takes \\
            To build it up \\
            Piece by piece \\
            Make it come true \\
            And then release \\
            Release the true power of my 21 \\
            More power than The sun \\

        \begin{verse}
            We did not have to meet \\
            For I knew what would be \\
            A sign from above \\
            And I could see \\
            I could see our friendship grow \\
            Because none of us were afraid to show \\
            Show our true selves to each other \\
            I couldn't even see if I were your brother \\
            But a thing came in the way \\
            I thought it would be fine \\
            You had a boyfriend \\
            You needed your time to shine \\
            But I slowly fell for you \\
            It was something I didn't want \\
            I swore not too \\
            But you are just so unique \\
            In a wonderful way \\
            Like the times I'm tired to go \\
            And you want me to stay \\
            The things you tell me \\
            I have never heard before \\
            But I know you are true \\
            And that makes me sure \\
            That I have fallen for you \\
            It I hope that you see \\
            That I wish that right now \\
            That it could be you and me \\

            I hope I have nothing to fear \\
            As a poem this is the worst \\

            Like it was never right \\
            Like the past is grey

            I'm ready for more \\
            I'm ready to go \\
            I'm ready to soar \\
            I can be the hero \\
            I can take resistance \\
            I can bloom the flower \\
            I can walk the distance \\
            You can't follow the beat \\
            You can't get your way \\
            For what ever you do \\
            You cannot stay \\
            Earth, water, fire or flame \\
            What ever you do \\
            You live in shame \\
            But I move on \\
            I become new \\
            I become many \\
            I become few \\
            I am what I once became \\
            I am old \\
            But never the same \\
            I am new and I am free \\
            I am... \\
            I am all of me \\

            Even though you hate me \\
            I will always love you \\

            I love you, I love you so \\
            That is why \\
            I can't let you go \\
            I have loved you forever long \\
            I have loved you forever strong \\
            You are the one that makes me smile \\
            I wish you could make it last a while \\

            My young fair maiden \\
            So sweet and wise \\
            Forever I could stare \\
            Right intro your eyes \\
            And I hope one day \\
            That our lips will meet \\
            Oh that moment \\
            So tender and sweet \\
            But now you've left \\
            My heart confused \\
            Did you say yes \\
            Or were you re-fused? \\
            I know how people \\
            Can make one mad \\
            But even just you say it \\
            It makes me sad \\
            But I know \\
            That I'm one of the few \\
            That is strong enough to say \\
            I love you \\
            And if that is not good enough \\
            I guess I have to grow up \\
            I have to be tough \\
            But please \\
            I hope you see \\
            That I will love you forever \\
            And all eternity \\

            Sometimes I wish I saw the right \\
            Before the wrong \\
            Sometimes I wish for the future \\
            But I will never live strong \\

        \begin{verse}
            The times you wish you were the hero \\
            The times you wish you were the star \\
            The times you don't longer need to follow \\
            But become who you are \\
            But listen to my words \\
            As I tell the tale \\
            As I make my way \\
            As I sett my sail \\
            Some love is meant to die \\
            Some love is meant to become \\
            But my love is meant to be given \\
            And this love is meant to be done \\
            But bloom my heart \\
            As it would never stay \\
            Just bloom my heart \\
            Like I never was away \\
            Now make me right \\
            Or make me wrong \\
            It's your choice \\
            No mater weak or strong \\
            Just remember \\
            You can be the villain \\
            For all the crimes you do \\
            So sett it free \\
            Into the blue \\
            I don't need time \\
            I don't need day \\
            For all I use \\
            Is time to pray \\
            Pray that all \\
            Will be ok \\
            Pray that you \\
            Will always stay \\
            But even though am left alone \\
            And even though I'm sorry \\
            Whatever you say \\
            It's always the same story \\
            Just remember \\
            That what ever you say \\
            Or what ever you do \\
            I will be there \\
            Like your tattoo \\
            No, we can't all be heroes \\
            Some of us must fall \\
            But we will come back stronger \\
            As heroes us all \\

            Roses are red \\

            I've written a poem \\
            I've written it for you \\
            It's not about \\
            All the things you get \\
            And it's not about \\
            All the goals you set
            It's about love \\
            And sharing the joy \\
            Sharing the love \\
            Either girl or boy \\
            The question is not \\
            What is yours to get \\
            And the question is not \\
            If it will be regret \\
            It's about valentine \\
            The years true love \\
            The one days power \\
            To stare the stars above \\
            No need for gifts \\
            No need to stress \\
            No need to hurry \\
            Only you can impress \\
            But it's a flower for me \\
            Or a poem for you \\
            Cause roses are red \\
            And violets blue \\
            No need to wonder \\
            No need to be mine \\
            Just a simple question \\
            Will you be my valentine? \\

            I will not be as you \\
            I will just walk away \\

            Don't need space \\
            It's not a challenge \\
            It's not a race \\
            You have all the time \\

            But make sure \\

            With the though of you \\
            And that I must give \\
            I must give up \\

            You made me laugh \\
            When I made the choice \\
            To get on closer \\
            To stop your voice \\
            When we first kissed \\
            It was like I fell \\
            But you picked up \\
            So I could not tell \\
            If you liked it or not \\
            So I said: " what the hell!" \\
            We'll give it another shot \\
            So I kissed you again \\
            And it lasted eternal \\
            It made my brain rumble \\
            And my heart infernal \\
            You made it easy \\
            You made it good \\
            You made me believe \\
            That it was something I should \\
            So I did it \\
            I did it with pride \\
            And now my feelings \\
            Have no need to hide \\
            So maybe \\
            It was to funky \\
            But if it was \\
            We'll blame it on monkey \\

            Being the worst \\

            And days begin \\
            Some are good \\
            Some are bad \\
            But for all the times that were good \\
            They can't relate to the sad \\
            I live so happily \\
            All by the sun \\
            As time passed \\
            My era begun \\

    \poemtitle{Cheating Dream - LXVI}
        \begin{verse}
            An ice castle rises \\
            The snow will fall \\
            A new dream sets \\
            Controlling it all \\
            What is so wrong? \\
            It all seems so real \\
            Even though the ground might be red \\
            And the sky teal \\
            I did survive \\
            I made the dream cheat \\
            Although it only brought me \\
            Closer to my feet \\
            I all seemed so real \\
            But it was all fake \\
            Because I did fall down \\
            But I didn't break \\

    \poemtitle{The Man - LXVII}
        \begin{verse}
            Tied down to the chair \\
            Tied down by the man \\
            You though it would be fine \\
            And go by your plan \\
            But it drastically failed \\
            You ended up wrong \\
            What you thought was weak \\
            Stood up to be strong \\
            The man doesn't listen \\
            The man doesn't care \\
            You fought so little \\
            When you had it all to fear \\
            And now you want to go back \\
            But there is no back \\
            You have to let go \\
            You have to close down \\
            You have to go slow \\
            You don't have a choice \\
            You have to listen \\
            Listen to the mans voice \\
            There is no end \\
            For the pain you will get \\
            If you think otherwise \\
            You will regret \\
            So go away \\
            And never turn back \\
            To where ever you go \\
            I want you to stay \\
            The man said it \\
            The man made it \\
            You can't say other \\
            You can't stay other \\
            You won't be a sister \\
            You won't be a brother \\
            Now go away \\
            Go away \\
            And stay \\

        \begin{verse}
            This part is new \\
            It has changed a soul \\
            More powerful by thought \\
            Than to be seen as coal \\
            It is not bleak \\
            It's as light as the sky \\
            But before it became \\
            It was all a dark lie \\
            It was only encouraged \\
            By all the falls \\
            It was never broken down \\
            By gentle calls \\
            It grew more \\
            Every day \\
            You could try to kill it \\
            But it would still stay \\
            But itself got hold \\
            It figured what It had done \\
            What he had changed \\
            What he had become \\
            He changed once more \\
            Back to the light \\
            Finally it shined \\
            And it did shine bright \\
            It was finally nice \\
            It was finally free \\
            That shadow \\
            Turned out to be me \\

            Why is it dark \\
            When the sun shines bright? \\
            Why is it wrong \\
            When it is all so right? \\
            I Cannot move \\
            I Cannot stay \\
            I Want to be here \\
            But want to go away \\
            When it's all so easy \\
            It is all so hard \\
            When lightning strikes \\
            You'll get hit by a shard \\
            The damage is short \\
            But the pain is forever \\
            It feels like it's here \\
            Not hit me, never \\
            When all is wrong \\
            When the moon is high \\
            You cannot go back \\
            And you can't walk by \\

            I'm done with the Past \\
            I will reset my faults \\
            I will make it last \\
            This is my future! \\
            I can change it all \\
            I can start over \\
            Forget my fall \\
            I can now be the hero \\
            I can be all of me \\
            Why was I so dumb \\
            That I did not see \\
            That the only thing that was stopping \\
            Was me \\
            But all is gone \\
            The game has begun \\
            Time to go away \\
            Back to the sun \\
            The future that was told \\
            The past that was blue \\
            The ignorance of a human \\
            That would destroy his few \\
            The one that he cared for \\
            The ones that made him glad \\
            He turned on them \\
            He turned bad \\
            But I am done \\
            I have grown so strong \\
            I now know that they were right \\
            About me being wrong \\
            Now I will walk \\
            Like it was all a glitch \\
            I will walk, \\
            For I am Stitch \\

            And the paths he chose \\
            While the grass grows green \\
            And the leaves bloom too \\
            Because what he as dreamt \\
            Has now become true \\
            But he wish it was gone \\
            He wish it was fake \\
            He did not know the cost \\
            And what it would take \\
            Pay the price \\
            For all the mad \\
            For what is good \\
            Can also be sad \\

            She was a lonely girl \\
            He was a longing guy \\
            The story of them both \\
            Made me wonder why \\
            Why would a poor guy like him \\
            Ever fall for someone \\
            Whom he doesn't understand \\
            Ever from the start \\
            When she first touched his hand \\
            What would become \\
            None did know \\
            But it has to be special \\
            When you make someone go \\
            It was such a sight \\
            For what ever she said \\
            He would fight \\
            But she never saw him \\
            She just left \\
            He could just admit her \\
            Charge her for theft \\
            Because she made him believe \\
            She made it all start \\
            But from that moment \\
            She stole his heart \\

            What ever the decision \\
            That is what I would choose \\
            I have no past \\

            As time will begin \\

            The fire will flame \\

            And get your self a bone \\
            Just be ready when all is fallen \\
            And you lose your throne \\

            But not to worry \\
            Don't come undone \\
            Do not fear \\
            Or even run \\
            It will be over \\
            I trust my word \\
            Don't trust anyone \\
            For anything you've heard \\
            The time of bad \\
            The time of good \\
            Now, it all ends \\
            The only it could \\

            Shadows everywhere \\
            The darkness is all around \\
            It's covering my senses \\
            I can't hear a sound \\
            But I don't want to hear \\
            I cover up more \\
            I guess you have to act now \\
            Don't wait before \\
            But the shadows cover my soul \\
            The darkness fils my heart \\
            There is no end \\
            To this start \\
            The only end is the impossible \\
            You wouldn't care a bit \\
            You wouldn't care to mend \\
            You would only hit \\
            Because that's how \\
            Darkness works \\
            You should know that \\
            One person of all \\
            But I guess the caring \\

        \begin{verse}
            The truth is so hidden \\
            The truth is so bold \\
            But that is why i look back \\
            To the memories we hold \\
            The moon is still there \\
            The love never disappeared \\
            When it all ended \\
            It was with what I feared \\
            You told me otherwise! \\
            You told me a lie \\
            But I guess you were afraid \\
            To say goodbye \\
            But so was I \\
            But it was for the best \\
            I hope I didn't got lost \\
            Like all the rest \\
            But I had to do it \\
            To take a stand \\
            Cherish the one \\
            That hides Amaranth in a land \\
            So far away \\
            I was all of me \\
            But it was your heart \\
            That could not see \\
            I was the hero \\
            You were the one \\
            But now I'm the villain \\
            And we are done \\
            The flower bloomed \\
            The stitches been laid \\
            While you were happy \\
            I was afraid \\
            My valentine \\
            My sweet monkey kiss \\
            How could you betray me? \\
            Treat me like this? \\
            How is it that the pain is forever \\
            But action is now? \\
            For I will always know why \\
            But wonder how \\
            But that is how I chose to live \\
            You chose it too \\
            But I no longer live \\
            Because I lost you \\
            The love that you lost \\
            Is far worse \\
            Than what I lost \\
            And what you set on curse \\
            A short start \\
            An everlasting end \\
            The love of first sight \\
            Fading to a friend \\
            But that friend \\
            I don't want to be \\
            I want to forget \\
            I want you to see \\
            That what you meant to me \\
            Is not to be thrown around \\
            Because every time I smiled \\
            You threw me to the ground \\
            But it is over now \\
            No final kiss \\
            The tears will go down \\
            All because of this \\

            It is time \\
            I am done \\
            My era is over \\
            My plan has began \\
            You believe \\
            Of what you see \\
            I believe \\
            What is all of me \\
            A new time \\
            A never fading rain \\
            The sun is hidd \\
            Behind all the pain \\
            But I have rissen \\
            I have come back \\
            Not for you \\
            Never for that \\
            I am done with you \\
            I am done with all \\
            But the used ones \\
            They bring light \\
            They give the motivation \\
            For one to fight \\
            But as I am forced to move \\
            As I walk into my past \\
            Never turn back \\
            Did never last \\
            Because Turing back \\
            For me, is the only way \\
            Because I oversaw \\
            That they where the ones to stay \\
            But cherish the one \\
            The one that you oversaw \\
            Because you will be shocked \\
            You will have awe \\
            So can you see all of me? \\
            Walk right into \\
            My mystery \\
            Step inside and pray for light \\
            Pray right now \\
            Pray for it is right \\
            Because the light of blue \\
            Can only be seen by few \\

            The perfect bottle gin \\
            You cannot stop \\
            Your hands shaking bright \\
            What you know is wrong \\
            Is still what feels right \\
            The smoke of cigarets \\
            The fire of ones house \\
            The drinking of whiskey \\
            Undressing of a blouse \\
            You know its wrong \\
            But where to go? \\
            When without it \\
            Your life feels slow \\
            You know what is wrong \\
            Life has the perfect prediction \\
            The final thought \\
            For your everlasting addiction \\

        \begin{verse}
            A fallen angel \\
            A far awau land \\
            Taking the step \\
            To go closer to her hand \\
            Sitting still \\
            For a response \\
            When you wanted gold \\
            But all ended was bronze \\
            The fallen angel \\
            Revived by man \\
            Taken from heaven \\
            And done what can \\
            To get back to her land \\
            The land of the sky \\
            One's change like this \\
            One can't go by \\
            But to save an amaranth \\
            One needs strength \\
            Because one love \\
            Does not hold for the length \\
            One needs passion \\
            To hold the sacred one \\
            For what time you have been given \\
            Has almost just begun \\
            You must bless it \\
            Bless it with all heart \\
            Not after the end \\
            But from the start \\
            Never stop \\
            Not even for glory \\
            Not ever \\
            To end this story \\

            Upside down \\
            Sakasama ni \\
            The one sentence \\
            To let it be \\
            The blue book \\
            That could would be the one \\
            The one book \\
            That took all and begun \\
            The green highway of love \\
            The road of fire \\
            The one book \\
            That I thinks would take me higher \\
            But it stayed alone \\
            It never got any way \\
            The death note took over \\
            It lost it's hope to stay \\
            But it is there \\
            Never to be forgotten \\
            Never to be lost \\
            But sadly it will rotten \\
            Because this is how it works \\
            With the things without care \\
            Because of now going far \\
            That is the one feared fear \\

            For each of them \\
            Had something I wrote \\
            But one of them \\
            Got swept in time \\
            The others made it \\
            And got their rhyme \\
            For one was my fair maiden \\
            The other made me bloom \\
            One was named luna \\
            And the other made doom \\
            Only four \\
            Could make one see the light \\
            For only these four \\
            Can make what's right \\
            Luna the Amaranth \\
            Fair Maiden of Time \\
            The knight of the wind \\
            The mystic Mime \\

            How did it come to this? \\
            How did my fate go by? \\
            All I know It's as \\
            The godly heavens die \\

            Now it all to be right \\
            Through the straight pass of suffering \\
            The martyrs even trod, \\
            Their feet upon temptation, \\
            Their faces upon God. \\

            They go forever more \\
            They fight for all the good \\
            They fight through all the sore \\
            Don't try to bloom the flower \\
            Don't try to stitch the lies \\
            The villains evil power \\
            Can see through spiritus eyes \\
            The hero is no longer here \\
            The villain is all that lives \\
            Though my solders power \\

        Love brought us here \\
        Right back to where we belong \\
        But i thought it would be right \\
        And continue to make us strong \\
        Help me! \\
        You made me want to go back \\
        But you know in your heart \\
        That I cannot do that \\
        We followed the moon \\
        And here we are \\
        One as a villain \\
        The other as a star \\
        Everything  \\
        Has started again \\
        From being unknown \\
        To being your friend \\
        And from this part \\

        I want to leave now \\

            How could it not be bad? \\
            How did it all go better? \\
            Why didn't I turn up sad? \\

            Be opposite of my fears? \\
            It became what I wanted \\

            The dead overcame him \\
            The dead changed his heart \\
            The dead made him forget \\
            Gave him a new start \\
            The dead gave him a better life \\
            Or so as he thought \\
            For their cheap tricks and games \\
            Were the only thing he bought \\
            He was hipnotized \\
            The dead took him back \\

            What he once would attack \\

            Is the deads only cost \\
            Dreams you will get! \\

            The dead once again brought pain \\
            But he will change! \\
            For he will change their gain! \\
            Their gain will be lost \\
            Their gain will be a loss \\
            Away from his heart \\
            And so long a boss \\
            But for love \\
            He will do all the right \\
            For he is the hero \\
            He will fight \\
            Love will always be great \\
            Love will always be put first \\
            For the dancing dead is bad \\
            For the dancing dead is worst \\
            The dead dancing \\

            The era of monkeys \\
            The dawn of the fish \\
            For the time of the hour \\
            Has come for your wish \\
            And if you are not ready \\
            Your wish will still come true \\
            For that is not decided by me \\
            It is decided by you \\

            When the wolves howl \\

            That is when \\
            You see who is your firend \\
            And that one true friend \\
            Is your lonlyness alone \\
            For all feelings \\
            Are like carvings on stone \\
            The stay here forever \\

            What would he become \\
            And what would be \\
            Are what would be asked \\
            In the distant past \\
            But why do we wonder \\
            Upon things that last? \\
            Why oh why \\
            Do we suffer pain \\
            When we never even see \\
            A slight view of gain \\
            When the world turns \\
            When the time does tick \\
            That is when we wonder \\
            What choices we must pick \\
            For we can only pick one \\
            There is no other choice \\
            For in a humans heart \\
            There is only one voice \\
            We cannot all learn \\
            Not from what others see \\
            For those are the things \\
            That a few can only be \\
            But now I say \\
            That power can be found \\
            For our existence is free \\
            But only for the unbound  \\
            So over the hills \\
            And far away \\
            That is the place \\

            But when my honey lost momentum \\
            And the bills were piling high \\
            That's when the light had finally faded \\
            From the apple of her eye \\
            That is how it is \\
            That is how it was \\
            Memoria, \\
            I'm here because \\
            Of what you made \\
            That one December day \\
            What you said \\
            To make me stay \\
            Make my feelings for you \\
            Never go away \\
            I called it love \\
            You called it foreplay \\
            The joke is not funny \\
            The joke is on me \\
            For I am the one \\
            That did not see \\
            That Memoria \\
            The 3rd one of the four \\
            Was the one \\
            That I would beg for more \\

    \poemtitle{Second - CXI}
        \begin{verse}
            When poems first started \\
            When romance first begun \\
            That was when I was the moon \\
            And you were the sun \\
            We were so different \\
            But yet so alike \\
            For that late night \\
            I hit my strike \\
            Your love turned to hate \\
            And my love turned sad \\
            When I cried my eyes to tears \\
            While you still were mad \\
            I said I was sorry \\
            Yet the mistake was yours \\
            Because you were to jealous \\
            To finish your chores! \\
            You did not inspect  \\
            You simply said I lied \\
             But still I was the one that was evil \\
            But yet the one that cried \\
            And still you are in my heart \\
            You are still one of the four \\
            Because of what we finished \\
            I wanted more \\
            Because you simply gave up \\
            I continue to look \\
            But forever the time went \\
            And forever it all took \\
            My sweet fair maiden \\
            You are still there \\
            But upon you I laid \\
            My promise to swear \\

    \poemtitle{Wind - I}
        \begin{verse}
            I said my sorrows \\
            I said my pain \\
            I built it up \\
            And grew my grain \\
            Like corn on a field \\
            And like the wind in the sky \\
            The sun bright shining \\
            And the clouds floating by \\
            For the years good harvest \\
            Rain clouds are a great need \\
            For it is what will make \\
            The food that will feed \\
            Now it is ready \\
            Now in the harvest's eye \\
            For now the wind is now blowing \\
            And the clouds floating by \\
        \end{verse}
    \poemtitle{Memory Tree - II}
        \begin{verse}
            Wild men chopping \\
            Down on all the free \\
            Chopping down memories \\
            Like it was all a tree \\
            Where all once stood \\
            There is nothing but dust \\
            For what was important \\
            Was destroyed by lust \\
            By somebody's ego \\
            By somebody's own gain \\
            For what the cutting brough \\
            Was nothing but intolerable pain \\
            Where memories once lied \\
            Now is in ruins and ash \\
            For where the love was gained \\
            Is now turned into scrap and trash \\
            Where he first touched her lips \\
            Where they both remember back \\
            Where they both lied down \\
            Where their past will always track \\
            Is now a place they despite \\
            Where they cry in pain \\
            Where it shined in the sun \\
            But now it shutters in rain \\
        \end{verse}
    \poemtitle{The Rain - III}
        \begin{verse}
            Living in the palace \\
            Where it is all in place \\
            Living in the rain \\
            Living in grace \\
            Where all is fine \\
            Where we wait \\
            For the time \\
            To come back \\
            To the reality \\
            That we once shared \\
            Back to the past \\
            And back to what we fared \\
            The rain \\
            Pouring down \\
            It's where you left it \\
            Left your crown \\
            You went away \\
            Away to the place \\
            Of the places I could not stay \\
            So I stayed here \\
            I stayed in the rain \\
            In shame and grace \\
            In tears and pain \\
            But that is what I wanted \\
            Wanted all along \\
            Going back to the sun \\
            And staying strong \\
            But I knew in my heart \\
            That it would not last \\
            For an evicton of future \\
            Cannot resolve the past \\
            For as I was ignoring the future \\
            As I was ignoring the rain \\
            I was ignoring the flashbacks \\
            And i was ignoring the pain \\

    \poemtitle{Nuzlocke - IV}
        \begin{verse}
            Random people \\
            New worlds to explore \\
            Because what was expected \\
            Was needed for more \\
            But the unexplored \\
            Is as deadly as the thought \\
            Because what a challenge \\
            That timed what you caught \\
            As you even walk forward
            As your thoughts never turn \\
            As you recover from your bruises \\
            As you make the world burn \\
            For what you desire \\
            For what you once need \\
            Is what the nuzlocke wants \\
            And what the inspiration feeds \\
            For random as it may be \\
            For tasks of higher rate \\
            The nuzlocke chooses desire \\
            The nuzlocke chooses fate \\

    \poemtitle{The Dark (Amnesia II) - V}
        \begin{verse}
            As the past follows in \\
            As the dark flows back \\
            As the screams go wider \\
            As the darkness attacks \\
            Amnesia razing  bleak \\
            A knife cutting through \\
            As the blood goes to the floor \\
            He goes looking for you! \\
            For as long as I don't remember \\
            I can't live like that \\
            I have to move forward \\
            And never turn back! \\
            For when in  the dark \\
            When it's all around \\
            The amnesia is heard \\
            But still without a sound \\
            A man in black \\
            A doctor in white \\
            An actor with  beauty  \\
            And a future so bright \\
            But the  doctor was evicted \\
            And the director was cut \\
            For as soon as it was done \\
            His world was shut \\
            Once again amnesia \\
            Once again my friend \\
            For the next time \\
            I will descend! \\

    \poemtitle{The Librarian Secret - VI}
        \begin{verse}
            A true past \\
            An adventure once ended \\
            One that was retrieved \\
            The one that was befriended \\
            For as long as the past goes \\
            Back to before the book \\
            Back when times were simple \\
            Where it was what it took \\
            And love, was as true as first sight \\
            Where love was as floating \\
            As a shining stars light \\
            That is where it was begun \\
            The past that's future is now \\
            This is where it got \\
            Through all the what and how \\
            The secret \\
            Of The Librarian Bird \\
            The secrets so hidden \\
            It can no longer be heard \\
            But two still remember \\
            For the force will bring them back \\
            For what he once desired \\
            Was what she once would lack \\
            The one first night \\
            Where the broadcast went viral \\
            Where they first intertwined \\
            And their love learned the spiral \\
            The second day met again \\
            Where their paths was crossed once more \\
            Where the spark was ignited \\
            And the sadness was poor \\
            But the days were dark \\
            And the time went blue \\
            For he thought they would never \\
            Ever make it through \\
            Through the spirals end \\
            Where he could get desire most \\
            For the Bird was his maiden \\
            And the past was his host \\
            They traveled far and wide \\
            Cried sorrow like a newborn \\
            But the night is always darkest \\
            Just before the dawn \\
            And the night was dark \\
            And they met once more \\
            This time the love \\
            Was no longer sore \\
            The love they shared \\
            Come together at last \\
            For that one final night \\
            To end their past \\
            Sleep once again \\
            God of things above \\
            For the time has come \\
            For the joy to all love \\
            The past now future \\
            The past of the bird \\
            The  true adventure ended \\
            The spirit now is heard \\

    \poemtitle{The Mountains - VII}
        \begin{verse}
            Running at speeds \\
            Unknown to mankind \\
            Searching the mountains \\
            For what one cannot find \\
            A wide quest \\
            A fearsome beast \\
            Untamable creature \\
            Dangerous at least \\
            Running for your life \\
            Jumping across the land \\
            Turning  water into steam \\
            And  rocks into sand \\
            A fire in a flask \\
            The only thing that's warm \\
            The only thing to make you survive \\
            The endless shipwreck storm \\
            Endless suffering \\
            But a bright shining light \\
            One firefly put to rest \\
            And one to join the fight \\
        \end{verse}
    \poemtitle{The Heat - VIII}
        \begin{verse}
            Sutring cold \\
            One winter seat \\
            The fire in the flask \\
            Is all the heat \\
            But don't cry \\
            For it will all go by plan \\
            For any girl in the way \\
            I will be your man \\
            No matter what \\
            The X will lead through \\
            It will bring you me \\
            And bring me you \\
        \end{verse}
    \poemtitle{Paths - IX}
        \begin{verse}
            It is in all we see \\
            It is in all we know \\
            But we can't all decide \\
            What is the right path to go \\
            Some may offer \\
            The life of the gray \\
            Some may differ  \\
            And lie to stay away \\
            But when two paths collide \\
            In the moonlight and snow \\
            What paths to chaos \\
            And what paths to flow? \\
            And what if a robin \\
            Mysteriously flys by \\
            Would it be a hello \\
            Or would it be goodbye? \\
            If so much pain \\
            Would lead to this \\
            Then the answer to the question \\
            Is no simple kiss \\
            For a kiss is a path \\
            In which a lover must stand \\
            But the fighter doesn't have to \\
            He can take her hand \\
            And they can live in peace \\
            And they can live in grace \\
            But is that really where \\
            The soldier can take place? \\
            What ever the answer is \\
            It will not be liked or famed \\
            What ever the answer is \\
            It will be locked and framed \\
            For a despicable answer \\
            And a terrible fate \\
            What paths to sadness \\
            And what paths to hate? \\
        \end{verse}
    \poemtitle{Burning Icicles to tend to the dead - X}
        \begin{verse}
            As I set foot into where I was \\
            As I set foot into my past \\
            As I break the barrier \\
            And walk out of the cast \\
            As time sets it's remark \\
            And brings back the street \\
            As the history change \\
            And sets you back on your feet \\
            Back to the day thought was right \\
            The day made of freedom \\
            Where you were born to fight \\
            But now I'm back to the night \\
            Back to where I started to stay \\
            But my past was distant \\
            And made me walk away! \\
            I pushed on \\
            Minding what I want \\
            But a dent in the book \\
            Simply changes the front \\
            For the very page of existence \\
            Can never disappear \\
            It can bring back memories \\
            And turn them into fear \\
            I hope they understood \\
            Why I chose who was right \\
            But that choice was wrong \\
            And I couldn't stand the sight \\
            Of my Memoria \\
            Being let loose \\
            For the broken \\
            Is the one I would choose \\
            But how can one \\
            Be so wrong \\
            After all this time \\
            Of staying strong? \\
            The hero doesn't know \\
            Neither the knight \\
            For none of them knew \\
            Who was the right \\
            For he was blinded by fear \\
            And struck to the ground \\
            For he could not see \\
            For the love he had found \\
            This one day \\
            My mistakes got made \\
            For these are the mistakes \\
            That would later have to be payed \\
            Followed by a ship \\
            Sailing into peace \\
            He saw a new sail \\
            And he sailed with ease \\
            But the wrong direction \\
            Can lead to the one who tend \\
            Should have known right from the start \\
            You can't predict the end \\

            Watching the eyes of pray \\

            Sinking \\
            Feeling as good as love lets you do \\

            If love can say yes \\
            If I can say no \\
            If the sun can shine bright \\
            And weather make it snow \\
            Can I do the marker's work? \\
            Can I finish a crime? \\
            Can I deal with the four, \\
            When ever it is time? \\
            Questions of fate \\
            Never changes for good \\
            Maybe it's bad \\

            If a lion should meet \\
            With a tigers eye \\
            And they both get along \\
            Who of them would die? \\
            And when, how and where? \\
            Do I ask the formidable guy \\
            For I can't get the answers \\
            From someone so shy \\
            That the answers \\
            Cannot be solved \\
            For that is what it said \\
            And what we were told \\
            Like the fish in the sea \\
            And a prawn diving the deep \\
            The answers are simple \\
            But the mountain is steep \\

            The shop of hope moved \\
            And the price of whatever cost \\
            Like a train moving forward \\
            To a station without talk \\
            Where the snow gently falls \\
            And where all the memories walk \\
            Where I once stood \\
            Waiting for you \\
            And when the train moved forward \\
            Your love did too \\
            For when we reached our destination \\
            When I reached into your heart \\
            When the light switched off \\
            And when our paths grew apart \\
            Where our lives entangled \\
            For the very first time \\
            And where you paid the price \\
            For every single rhyme \\
            And as I tripped back home \\
            After the love of a memory \\
            That is when I noticed \\
            You were my number three \\
            And when I stepped on the train \\
            Moving to my station \\
            That is when I discovered \\
            You were my destination \\

            Riding in the night \\
            New places, new days \\
            The feeling to feeling home \\
            Is the only thing that stays \\
            And the other \\
            Floats along \\
            Like a day bright sunshine \\
            Shining so strong \\
            But in the dark shadows \\
            And deep ice snow \\
            There is one place hidden \\
            Where no one can go \\
            So secret \\
            That only two men have ventured there \\
            For in the bright night \\
            It's presence is all but clear \\
            One can only go \\
            With the purest of heart \\
            And one will venture back \\
            Pure from the start \\
        \end{verse}
        \poemtitle{Hurricane One - XV}
        \begin{verse}
            What keeps us warm \\
            And what keeps us aside \\
            What brings us down \\
            And what controls the tide \\
            It's all a simple question \\
            One simple solution \\
            Not rich or poor \\
            Nor death or pollution \\
            But there is one thing \\
            That makes us all mingle \\
            It's this lonely feeling \\
            And butterfly tingle \\
            The way of communication \\
            And the way of chemistry \\
            How can one be so lonely \\
            But yet so free? \\
            It's just like a quest \\
            Riding with your lord \\
            Watching his every move \\
            And every lunge of his sword \\
            Watching and learning \\
            Learning to learn \\
            Watching his move \\
            Every road, every turn \\
            But a drop o blood \\
            Or a lock of hair \\
            Choosing one like this \\
            Would it all be fair? \\
            Green or brown \\
            Blue or blond \\
            What ever one can say \\
            One can always grow fond \\
            Of things that might sound strange \\
            And things that  might look pale \\
            For what ever colour reason \\
            I will set my boat to sail \\
            Oh the past memory \\
            And the present hurricane \\
            One came to the heart \\
            But the other, deadly pain \\
        \end{verse}
        \poemtitle{Afternoon - XVI}
        \begin{verse}
            Tie My heart \\
            And pull the strings \\
            For loss it gives \\
            But pain it brings \\
            What will I be \\
            Once now the end is soon \\
            For I can look up \\
            And see the moon \\
            One star \\
            Maybe here and there \\
            But the place will remain \\
            Where I once shed my tear \\
            Where we once stood \\
            And now cannot care \\
            The place written down \\
            3 letters it is long \\
            Moving to a loss \\
            Only proves I'm wrong \\
            The wait is over \\
            The end is near \\
            For a whole world stunned \\
            A whole world full of fear \\
        \end{verse}
